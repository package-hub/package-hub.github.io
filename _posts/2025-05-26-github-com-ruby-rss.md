### RSS reading and writing


Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a family of formats that describe _feeds_, specially constructed XML documents that allow an interested person to subscribe and receive updates from a particular web service. This portion of the standard library provides tooling to read and create these feeds.

The standard library supports RSS 0.91, 1.0, 2.0, and Atom, a related format. Here are some links to the standards documents for these formats:

* RSS
  * [0.9.1](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-0-9-1-netscape)
  * [1.0](http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/)
  * [2.0](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification)
* [Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287)
