### The Axios API, as an 800 byte Fetch wrapper.


[Axios] has a great API that developers love. Redaxios provides that API in **800 bytes**, using native `fetch()`.

For those searching for ways to shave a few kilobytes off of their bundles, that's less than 1/5th of the size. This is made possible by using the browser's native [Fetch API][fetch], which is [supported in all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) and polyfilled by most tools including Next.js, Create React App and Preact CLI.
