## [Vanilla-Normals-Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed)

### Vanilla textures made compatible with SEUS PTGI (and other PBR minecraft shaders) for Minecraft ≥ 1.13 

A shaders compatible minecraft texture pack, based on vanilla but with normals and proper glossiness information.
This resourcepack is compatible with both the "oldPBR" and "labPBR" standards, and should work correctly with most shaders.

⚠️ This version is made for Minecraft 1.16 and above ⚠️
