### Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android


**NOTE:** On June 3rd, 2020, Mapbox released the `1.0` version of the Navigation SDK. The Mapbox team recommends that you build your navigation project with a `1.0` version or higher.

[Here are `1.0` installation instructions](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/beta/navigation/overview/#installation) and full documentation can be found along the sidebar sections of https://docs.mapbox.com/android/beta/navigation/overview.

Along with the full documentation, [this migration guide](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/1.0-Navigation-SDK-Migration-Guide) can help you transition your project from a "legacy" version of the Navigation SDK (`0.42.6` or below) to a `1.0` version or higher.

Please see [this documentation link](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/overview/) if you're looking for information on the "legacy" pre-`1.0.0` Navigation SDK and you don't plan on migrating your project to `1.0.0` or higher.
