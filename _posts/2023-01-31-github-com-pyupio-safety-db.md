### A curated database of insecure Python packages


Safety DB is a database of known security vulnerabilities in Python packages. The data is made available by [pyup.io](https://pyup.io/) and synced with this repository once per month. Most of the entries are found by filtering CVEs and changelogs for certain keywords and then manually reviewing them.
