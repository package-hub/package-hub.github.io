## [laravel-search](https://github.com/mmanos/laravel-search)

### A search package for Laravel 5.


This package provides a unified API across a variety of different full text search services. It currently supports drivers for [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), and [ZendSearch](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSearch) (good for local use).
