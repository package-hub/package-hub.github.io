### MCEdit 2.0 - World Editor for Minecraft.


MCEdit 2.0 is the next version of MCEdit, the World Editor for Minecraft. MCEdit allows you to edit every aspect of
a Minecraft world, and to import and export .schematic files created by many programs including WorldEdit and the
original MCEdit 1.x. It is free to use and licensed under the BSD license.

MCEdit 2.0's development is in the alpha stage. Many features may be buggy or missing. To download MCEdit 2.0 anyway, head over to
