## [react-native-admob-native-ads](https://github.com/ammarahm-ed/react-native-admob-native-ads)

### A simple and robust library for creating & displaying Admob Native Advanced Ads in your React Native App using Native Views.


We on the other hand do not load ads in a WebView. We use a more complex, Native Advanced ad format to display ads. We request Admob servers to send us the ad information such as images, headlines, videos etc. Then we send this information over the bridge to React Native and render it in React Native's View and Text components execpt a few exceptions where we use our own custom components.
