### A RubyGems plugin that compares versions of the given gem


gem-compare is a RubyGems plugin that compares different versions of the specified gem. It can help you to track changes in metadata through the time, see how dependencies were evolving and spot important changes in gem's files such as shebang or permissions modifications.

This is especially handy for:

- checking what goes into to a next gem release
- tracking dependencies and license changes before upgrades
- spotting anything suspicious and unusual
