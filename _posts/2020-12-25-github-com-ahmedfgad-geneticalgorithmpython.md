### Build the Genetic Algorithm Implementation in Python 3 using NumPy


[This project](https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython) is part of [PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) which is an open-source Python 3 library for building the genetic algorithm and optimizing machine learning algorithms. 

Check documentation of the [GeneticAlgorithmPython](https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython) project in the PyGAD's documentation: https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_pygad_ReadTheDocs.html

[PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) supports different types of crossover, mutation, and parent selection. [PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) allows different types of problems to be optimized using the genetic algorithm by customizing the fitness function. 

The library is under active development and more features are added regularly. If you want a feature to be supported, please check the **Contact Us** section to send a request.
