## [GestureViews](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews)

### ImageView and FrameLayout with gestures control and position animation


- Gestures support: pan, zoom, quick scale, fling, double tap, rotation.
- [Seamless integration](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Usage#viewpager) with ViewPager (panning smoothly turns into ViewPager flipping and vise versa).
- [View position animation](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Basic-animations) ("opening" animation). Useful to animate into full image view mode.
- [Advanced animation](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Advanced-animations) from RecyclerView (or ListView) into ViewPager.
- Exit full image mode by scroll and scale gestures.
- Rounded images with animations support. 
- [Image cropping](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Image-cropping) (supports rotation).
- [Lots of settings](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Settings).
- [Gestures listener](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Usage#listeners): down (touch), up (touch), single tap, double tap, long press.
- Custom state animation (animating position, zoom, rotation).
- Supports both ImageView and FrameLayout out of the box, also supports [custom views](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews/wiki/Custom-views).
