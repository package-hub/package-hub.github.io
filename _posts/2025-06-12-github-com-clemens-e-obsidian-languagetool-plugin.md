### languagetool plugin for obsidian


This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) that integrates [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) to provide advanced Grammar and Spell Checking.

> ***⚠️ This Plugin is in maintenance mode***   
> It does everything I want it to do, unless it breaks I do not have intentions to update it further.  
> Feel free to open Issues/Suggestions but please understand that I'm devoting my free time to other things.  
> You are however welcome to create Pull Request and I will review/merge them and release new versions accordingly.

Note: if you are worried about the privacy of your notes you should selfhost languagetool, whether it be locally on your pc or on a server
[Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/erikvl87/languagetool)

If you decide to self host the service, you need to change the link in the configuration accordingly.
