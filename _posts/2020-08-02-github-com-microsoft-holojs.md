## [HoloJS](https://github.com/microsoft/HoloJS)

### Provides a framework for creating holographic apps using JavaScript and WebGL.

The fastest way to create VR and AR experiences with HoloJs is to use the [Spin](https://github.com/microsoft/HoloJS/releases) tool and Visual Studio Code. Spin is a HoloJs execution host that integrates with Visual Studio Code for a seamless run and debug experience. Please refer to [VR and AR experiences with Spin](https://microsoft.github.io/HoloJS/spin-make.html) for more details.

Alternatively, use the [HoloJs Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/holojs) for embedding it into Win32 and UWP apps. Please refer to [HoloJs in Win32 apps](https://microsoft.github.io/HoloJS/win32-apps.html) and [HoloJs in UWP apps](https://microsoft.github.io/HoloJS/uwp-apps.html) for detailed instructions.

Lastly, HoloJs can be built from scratch and customized as needed.
