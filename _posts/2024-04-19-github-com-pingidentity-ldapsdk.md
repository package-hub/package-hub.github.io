### UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java


[Download the Latest Release of the LDAP SDK Here](https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases)

The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is a fast, powerful, user-friendly, and completely free and open source Java library for communicating with LDAP directory servers. It offers better performance, better ease of use, and more features than other Java-based LDAP APIs. It is developed by [Ping Identity Corporation](https://www.pingidentity.com/) and is actively being maintained and enhanced as a critical component of Ping Identity client and server software.

The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is free to use and redistribute in open source or proprietary applications under the terms of the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE.md), which is a very permissive OSI-approved open source license. For legacy purposes, the software is also available under the terms of the GNU [GPLv2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/master/LICENSE-GPLv2.txt) or [LGPLv2.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/master/LICENSE-LGPLv2.1.txt) licenses, or the not-open-source-but-still-free-to-use [UnboundID Free Use License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/master/LICENSE-UnboundID-LDAPSDK.txt).

The LDAP SDK does not have any third-party dependencies beyond a Java 8 or higher Java Runtime Environment, so a single jar file is all you need to add top-notch LDAP support to your Java application. It can also be used in conjunction with most other JVM-based languages, as well as on the Android mobile platform.

The full documentation for the LDAP SDK is available online at [https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/index.html](https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/index.html). The API documentation (aka JavaDoc) for the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is available at [https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html](https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html). The [LDAP.com](https://ldap.com/) website also has a lot of useful information about LDAP and directory services.
