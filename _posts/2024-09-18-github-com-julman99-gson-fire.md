## [gson-fire](https://github.com/julman99/gson-fire)

### A java library that adds some very useful features to Gson, like Date serializing to unix timestamp or RFC3339, method (getters) serialization, pre/post processors and many others. Check out the documentation to learn how to use it!


This project implements some useful features missing from the extremely useful [Gson project](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)

There is no attempt to modify any existing behavior or existing class of Gson. In fact, this project depends on Gson.
The main objective is to extend Gson using TypeAdapter and TypeAdapterFactory instances to support more features.
