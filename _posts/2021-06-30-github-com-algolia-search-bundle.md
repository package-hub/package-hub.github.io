## [search-bundle](https://github.com/algolia/search-bundle)

### Seamless integration of Algolia Search into your Symfony project.


 * **Simple**: You can get started with only 5 lines of YAML
 * **Robust**: It benefits from all the new features of our PHP Client v2, like the [`wait()`](/doc/api-reference/api-methods/wait-task/) method
 * **Flexible**: All methods take optional `$requestOptions` to let you handle your data as you wish
 * **Dev-friendly**: Auto-completion and type-hinting thanks to an exhaustive documentation

Algolia SearchBundle supports PHP > 7.1
