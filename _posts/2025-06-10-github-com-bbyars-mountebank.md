### Over the wire test doubles


Unfortunately, there are no easy exit ramps for hobbyist open source. I've greatly enjoyed building and maintaining mountebank, but after a decade, I find myself no longer having the energy or passion to continue to do so on nights, weekends, and holidays. Handing someone else that responsibility for a 10-year-old code base that they did not write is... challenging.

Please fork at will, and thank you for being part of the community.
