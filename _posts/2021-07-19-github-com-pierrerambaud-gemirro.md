### Gem to automatically make a rubygems mirror.


Gemirro is a Ruby application that makes it easy way to create your own RubyGems mirror without having to push or write all gem you wanted in a configuration file.
It does mirroring without any authentication and you can add your private gems in the `gems` directory.
More, to mirroring a source, you only need to start the server, and gems will automaticly be downloaded when needed.
