### Action Cable testing utils


This gem provides missing testing utils for [Action Cable][].

**NOTE:** this gem [has](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33659) [been](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33969) [merged](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34845) into Rails 6.0 and [into RSpec 4](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/pull/2113).
