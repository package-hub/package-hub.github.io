### Automated driver management and other helper features for Selenium WebDriver in Java

[WebDriverManager] is an open-source Java library that carries out the management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of the drivers required by [Selenium WebDriver] (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) in a fully automated manner. In addition, WebDriverManager provides other relevant features, such as the capability to discover browsers installed in the local system, building WebDriver objects (such as `ChromeDriver`, `FirefoxDriver`, `EdgeDriver`, etc.), and running browsers in Docker containers seamlessly.
