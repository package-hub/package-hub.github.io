## [gatsby-advanced-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter)

### A high performance skeleton starter for GatsbyJS with an advanced feature set.


A starter skeleton with advanced features for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

This starter aims to provide a minimal base for building advanced GatsbyJS powered websites by using the latest technologies to simplify your process.

It doesn't define any UI limitations in any way and only gives you the basic components for SEO/Links/Infinite Scrolling while creating a comfortable development environment to get started.

Starter supports both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and JavaScript, comes with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) configurations and allows you to write Unit/Integration/E2E tests out of the box.

You are free to use any UI framework/styling options or you can use the [`gatsby-theme-amaranth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-amaranth) as a starting point, which provides a stylish blog design styled with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
