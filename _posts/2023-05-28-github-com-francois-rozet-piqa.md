### PyTorch Image Quality Assessement package


PIQA is a collection of PyTorch metrics for image quality assessment in various image processing tasks such as generation, denoising, super-resolution, interpolation, etc. It focuses on the efficiency, conciseness and understandability of its (sub-)modules, such that anyone can easily reuse and/or adapt them to its needs.

> PIQA should be pronounced *pika* (like Pikachu ⚡️)
