### :closed_lock_with_key: Server API to support End-to-End Encryption


This app provides all the necessary APIs to implement End-to-End encryption
on the client side. Additionally it makes sure that End-to-End encrypted
files are not accessible with the web interface and other WebDAV clients.

Here you can find the [API documentation](https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption/blob/master/doc/api.md).
