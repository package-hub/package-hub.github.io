### Expo GitHub Action makes it easy to automate EAS builds or updates


With this Expo action, you have full access to the [Expo CLI][link-expo-cli] itself.
It allows you to fully automate the `expo publish` or `expo build` process, leaving you with more time available for your project.
There are some additional features included to make the usage of this action as simple as possible, like caching and authentication.
