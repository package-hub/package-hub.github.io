This repository provides the source code for the CosmiQ Works `solaris` project, which provides software tools for:
- Tiling large-format overhead images and vector labels
- Converting between geospatial raster and vector formats and machine learning-compatible formats
- Performing semantic and instance segmentation, object detection, and related tasks using deep learning models designed specifically for overhead image analysis
- Evaluating performance of deep learning model predictions
