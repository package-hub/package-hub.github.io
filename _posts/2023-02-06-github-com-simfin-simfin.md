### Simple financial data for Python


SimFin makes it easy to obtain and use financial and stock-market data in
Python. It automatically downloads share-prices and fundamental data from
the [SimFin](https://www.simfin.com/) server, saves the data to disk for
future use, and loads the data into Pandas DataFrames.
