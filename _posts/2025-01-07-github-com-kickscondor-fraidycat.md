## [fraidycat](https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat)

### Follow blogs, wikis, YouTube channels, as well as accounts on Twitter, Instagram, etc. from a single page.


Follows are arranged by tag - each can have multiple tags - the tabbed bar
along the top of the main page lets you select the tag to view. You then narrow
down by importance - tags can be checked in 'real-time' or 'daily', 'weekly',
'monthly' and 'yearly'.

Follows are shown in dark green if they have been updated in the past two days,
a plain cyan if they are up to a month old and in an unassuming light brown if they
are over a month old. A small graph of activity over the past year is displayed - in
pink (if showing the previous two months of activity) or in gray (if
showing the past six months.)

Fraidycat is quite light on features - I am mostly focused on making sure that
it supports a lot of different sites and that it safely syncs between your
different computers.
