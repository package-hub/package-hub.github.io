### React Native Drawer

This module is not as performant as it should be. For production applications we generally recommend using either [React Native Side Menu](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-side-menu) or [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) as applicable. React Native Drawer will continue to be available and potentially useful for its high customizability but again it is **not** recommended for production appliciations. If you are interested in revamping react native drawer to be more performant (i.e. use Animated) please get in touch!
