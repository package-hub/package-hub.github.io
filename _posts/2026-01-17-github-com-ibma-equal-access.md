###  IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker contains tools to automate accessibility checking from a browser or in a continuous development/build environment  


This Git repository hosts tools and supporting components of the [IBM Equal Access Toolkit](https://ibm.com/able/toolkit).
The Toolkit provides the tools and guidance to create experiences that are delightful for people of all abilities.
The guidance is organized by phase, such as Plan, Design, Develop, and Verify, and explains how to integrate these automated testing tools into the [Verify phase](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/verify/overview).
The Toolkit is a major part of the accessibility information and applications at [ibm.com/able](https://ibm.com/able/).
