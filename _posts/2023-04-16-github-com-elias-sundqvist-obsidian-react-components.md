### Write and use React (Jsx) components in your Obsidian notes.


This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It allows you to write and use React components with Jsx inside your Obsidian notes. 

It is highly recommended that you also install the [Editor Syntax Highlight Plugin](https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian) when using this plugin.
