### Cast media from Plex Mobile and Web apps to MPV. (Unofficial)


MPV Shim is a simple and lightweight Plex client, with support for Windows
and Linux. Think of it as an open source Chromecast for Plex. You can cast almost
anything from Plex and it will Direct Play. Subtitles are fully supported, and
there are tools to manage them like no other Plex client.
