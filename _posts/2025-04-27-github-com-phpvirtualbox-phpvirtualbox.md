### phpVirtualBox: A Web interface to manage and access VirtualBox machines


April 2025

Project adopted by Anonie Muss. Updated from https://github.com/studnitskiy/phpvirtualbox where
it had been modified to work with VirtualBox 7.1. Thanks to studnitskiy for his work, and now that
he is a member of the github project, I hope he will continue to contribute.
