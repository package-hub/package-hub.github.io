## [potpourri3d](https://github.com/nmwsharp/potpourri3d)

### An invigorating blend of 3D geometry tools in Python.


A Python library of various algorithms and utilities for 3D triangle meshes and point clouds. Managed by [Nicholas Sharp](https://nmwsharp.com), with new tools added lazily as needed. Currently, mainly bindings to C++ tools from [geometry-central](http://geometry-central.net/).

`pip install potpourri3d`

The blend includes:
- Mesh and point cloud reading/writing to a few file formats
- Use **heat methods** to compute distance, parallel transport, logarithmic maps, and more
