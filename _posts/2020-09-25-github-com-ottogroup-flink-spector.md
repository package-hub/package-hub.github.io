### Framework for Apache Flink unit tests


This project provides a framework to define unit tests for Apache Flink data flows.
The framework executes data flows locally and verifies the output using predefined expectations. 

Features include:
- Concise DSL to define test scenarios.
- Powerful matchers to express expectations.
- Test base for JUnit.
- Test stream windowing with timestamped input.
