### Web-based dashboard interface to check Raspberry Pi hardware and software status with no extra deependencies required.

- Detailed software/hardware information (web server, PHP, storage / partition workload, core voltage, plugged USB devices, kernel version, model specifications, OS, CPU, network config)
- Protected access with password login ([configure password](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard#configure-password-manually))
- Power (shutdown/reboot) Raspberry Pi with scheduling options ([setup instructions](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard#enable-shutdown--reboot-optional))
- Responsive mobile web-app

> Update your existing dashboard setup by navigating to project root folder and running `git pull` in the terminal. Please keep in mind, this only works if there are no changes in the workspace.
