## [notifme-sdk](https://github.com/notifme/notifme-sdk)

### A Node.js library to send all kinds of transactional notifications.


* **Easy channel integration** — Want to start sending `emails` | `SMS` | `pushes` | `webpushes` | `slack`? Do so in no time!

* **Unique documentation** — Don't look everywhere for the parameters you need to pass, just do it once. **Switching provider becomes a no-brainer**.

* **Multiple providers strategies** — Want to use more than one provider? Use `fallback` and `round-robin` strategies out of the box.

* **Tools for local testing** — Run a catcher locally to intercept all your notifications and display them in a web interface.

* **MIT license** — Use it like you want.
