### COPPER - a high performance Java workflow engine


Run `./gradlew eclipse` once. This will create Eclipse project files which you can import. This also creates proper code style settings. Before committing you should always reformat the code. You can configure Eclipse to do this automatically on each save.

Every time a dependency changes in `build.gradle` you must run `./gradlew eclipse` again. You don't need to restart Eclipse for this, simply press F5 on the projects.
