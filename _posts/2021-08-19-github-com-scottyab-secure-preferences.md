## [secure-preferences](https://github.com/scottyab/secure-preferences)

### Android Shared preference wrapper than encrypts the values of Shared Preferences. It's not bullet proof security but rather a quick win for incrementally making your android app more secure.

The **v0.1.0** release was a major refactor of the guts of secure prefs, which is *Not backwards compatible* yet with older 0.0.1 - 0.0.4 versions. So if you have an existing app using this don't upgrade. I'll be looking to add migration into a later release.
