## [procyon](https://github.com/mstrobel/procyon)

### Procyon is a suite of Java metaprogramming tools, including a rich reflection API, a LINQ-inspired expression tree API for runtime code generation, and a Java decompiler.


The `procyon-core` framework contains common support classes used by the other Procyon APIs.  Its facilities include string manipulation, collection extensions, filesystem/path utilities, freezable objects and collections, attached data stores, and some runtime type helpers.
