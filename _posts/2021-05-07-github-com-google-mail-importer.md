### Mail Importer for Gmail will upload the contents of a Thunderbird mail archive to Gmail and do its best to preserve the read state, flagged state, and folders of the messages.


Do you have an old Thunderbird mail archive that you POP3ed down from AOL?

Do you want to move those old messages to Gmail so that you can use the Gmail
app on your phone and still have access to everything?

If so, maybe _Mail Importer for Gmail_ is for you!

If you are trying to bulk import mbox format files to Google Apps for Work,
