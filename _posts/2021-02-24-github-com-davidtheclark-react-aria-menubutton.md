### A fully accessible, easily themeable, React-powered menu button


A React component (set of components, really) that will help you build accessible menu buttons by providing keyboard interactions and ARIA attributes aligned with [the WAI-ARIA Menu Button Design Pattern](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton).

Please check out [the demo](https://davidtheclark.github.io/react-aria-menubutton/demo/).
