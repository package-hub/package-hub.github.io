### Enterprise application server for Node.js and Metarhia private cloud ⚡


**First** Node.js server scaled with **multithreading** and extra thin workload
**isolation**. Optimized for **high-intensive** data exchange, rapid development,
and **clean architecture**. Provides everything you need out of the box for
**reliable** and **efficient backend**, network communication with web and mobile
clients, protocol-agnostic **API**, run-time type validation, real-time and
in-memory data processing, and **reliable stateful** services.

**Weak sides**: not a good choice for content publishing including blogs and
online stores, server-side rendering, serving static content and stateless
services.

**Strong sides**: security and architecture for enterprise-level applications,
long-lived connections over websocket to minimize overhead for cryptographic
handshake, no third-party dependencies.
