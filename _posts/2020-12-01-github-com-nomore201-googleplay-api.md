### Google Play Unofficial Python API


This project contains an unofficial API for google play interactions. The code mainly comes from
[GooglePlayAPI project](https://github.com/egirault/googleplay-api/) which is not
maintained anymore. The code was updated with some important changes:

* ac2dm authentication with checkin and device info upload
* updated search and download calls
* select the device you want to fake from a list of pre-defined values (check `device.properties`)
(defaults to a OnePlus One)
