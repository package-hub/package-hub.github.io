### The 3D renderer for PixiJS. Seamless integration with 2D applications.

Pixi3D is a JavaScript library which makes it easy to render 3D graphics on the web. It works for both desktop and mobile web browsers and includes several components which makes it easy to create nice looking 3D scenes out-of-the-box:

* Load models from file (glTF) or create procedural generated meshes
* Physically-based rendering (PBR) and image-based lighting (IBL)
* Transformation, morphing and skeletal animations
* Customized materials and shaders
* Built on top of PixiJS, seamless integration with 2D applications.
