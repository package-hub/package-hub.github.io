### Pronterface, Pronsole, and Printcore - Pure Python 3d printing host software


The master branch holds the development of Printrun 2.x. This version of Printrun supports Python 3 and wxPython 4. All new features and developments should be merged to it.

Printrun consists of printcore, pronsole and pronterface, and a small collection of helpful scripts.

  * printcore.py is a library that makes writing reprap hosts easy
  * pronsole.py is an interactive command-line host software with tabcompletion goodness
  * pronterface.py is a graphical host software with the same functionality as pronsole
