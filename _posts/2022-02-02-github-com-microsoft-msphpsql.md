### Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server


**Welcome to the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for Microsoft SQL Server**

The [Microsoft Drivers for PHP for Microsoft SQL Server][phpdoc] are PHP extensions that allow for the reading and writing of SQL Server data from within PHP scripts. The SQLSRV extension provides a procedural interface while the PDO_SQLSRV extension implements PHP Data Objects (PDO) for accessing data in all editions of SQL Server 2012 and later (including Azure SQL DB). These drivers rely on the [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server][odbcdoc] to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server.

This release contains the SQLSRV and PDO_SQLSRV drivers for PHP 7.3+ with improvements on both drivers and some limitations. Upcoming [releases][releases] will contain additional functionalities, bug fixes, and more.
