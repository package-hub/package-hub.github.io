## [gitfs](https://github.com/presslabs/gitfs)

### Version controlled file system


gitfs is a [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) file system that fully
integrates with git. You can mount a remote repository's branch locally, and any
subsequent changes made to the files will be automatically committed to the
remote.

gitfs was developed by the awesome engineering team at [Presslabs](https://www.presslabs.com/),
a Managed WordPress Hosting provider.
