### A T9 keyboard for Android devices with a hardware keypad.


TT9 is a 12-key T9 keyboard for devices with a hardware numpad. It supports predictive text typing in [40+ languages](app/languages/definitions), configurable hotkeys, text editing with undo/redo, and an on-screen keypad that can turn your smartphone into a Nokia from the 2000s. And, best of all, it [doesn't spy](docs/privacy.md) on you!

This is a modernized version of the [original project](https://github.com/Clam-/TraditionalT9) by Clam-.
