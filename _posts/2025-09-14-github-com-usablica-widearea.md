## [widearea](https://github.com/usablica/widearea)

### Create expandable textarea and write large amount of text easily.


Really simple. Just include both `widearea.js` and `widearea.css` in your page (use minified version for production) and then call this JavaScript function:

    wideArea();

See online [demo](http://usablica.github.io/widearea/).
