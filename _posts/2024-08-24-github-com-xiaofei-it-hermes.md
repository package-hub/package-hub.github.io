A smart, novel and easy-to-use framework for Android Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

[Chinese Readme 中文文档](https://github.com/Xiaofei-it/Hermes/blob/master/README-ZH-CN.md)

Hermes is a smart, novel and easy-to-use framework for Android Inter-Process Communication (IPC). In this framework, you can use IPC even if you do not understand the underneath principle of Android IPC.

Please click [HERE](https://github.com/Xiaofei-it/Hermes-IPC-Demo) to see the demo.

Also, [HermesEventBus](https://github.com/eleme/HermesEventBus) is a Hermes-and-EventBus-based library
which posts events between processes.

Note that maybe you will find that Hermes is still a little difficult to use. I have finished this
library and promoted the performance. What to do for my next step is to simplify the usage, which
will be released in version 0.7.0.
