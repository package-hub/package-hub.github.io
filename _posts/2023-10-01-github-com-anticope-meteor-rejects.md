## [meteor-rejects](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-rejects)

### An addon to Meteor Client with features that won't be added to Meteor. Because they were either rejected or are ports from other clients.

- Download the latest [release](/../../releases) of the mod from the releases tab.
- Put it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder where you have installed Meteor.

*Note: It is recommended to use the [latest dev build](https://meteorclient.com/download?devBuild=latest) of meteor while using rejects*
