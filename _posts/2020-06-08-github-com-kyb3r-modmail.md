### A feature rich discord Modmail bot


Modmail is similar to Reddit's Modmail, both in functionality and purpose. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.

This bot is free for everyone and always will be. If you like this project and would like to show your appreciation, you can support us on **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kyber)**, cool benefits included!
