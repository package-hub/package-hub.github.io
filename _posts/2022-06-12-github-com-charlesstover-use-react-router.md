### React Hook for pub-sub behavior using React Router.


`useReactRouter` is a React Hook that provides pub-sub behavior for `react-router`.
Unlike the `withRouter` Higher-Order Component, `useReactRouter` will re-render your component when the location changes!

`useReactRouter()` returns an object that contains the `history`, `location`, and `match` properties that would be passed as props by the HOC.

A tutorial covering the design and development of this package can be found on Medium: [How to Convert withRouter to a React Hook](https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/how-to-convert-withrouter-to-a-react-hook-19bb02a29ed6).
