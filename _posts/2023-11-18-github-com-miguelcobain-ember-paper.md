### The Ember approach to Material Design.


This project aims to bring Google's new [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) to Ember. The goal is to encapsulate everything possible in Ember components. This project is packaged as an [Ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) addon.
