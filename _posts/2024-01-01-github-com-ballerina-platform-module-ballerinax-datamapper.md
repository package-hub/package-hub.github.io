### A compiler extension to extract abstract representation of Ballerina connector actions and their associated types

The Ballerina Data Mapper extension is a compiler extension, which extracts an abstract representation of Ballerina connector actions and the associated types. 
This compiler extension gets executed when compiling a Ballerina connector project. The extension generates two types of files by default. Note that 
these two types of files get automatically extracted from connectors. Hence, the developer does not need to write them.
