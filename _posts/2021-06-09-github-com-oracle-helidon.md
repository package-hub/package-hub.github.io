### Java libraries for writing microservices


Project Helidon is a set of Java Libraries for writing microservices.
Helidon supports two programming models:

* Helidon MP: [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) 3.3
* Helidon SE: a small, functional style API

In either case your application is just a Java SE program.
