### A Comparative Framework for Multimodal Recommender Systems


**Cornac** is a comparative framework for multimodal recommender systems. It focuses on making it **convenient** to work with models leveraging **auxiliary data** (e.g., item descriptive text and image, social network, etc). **Cornac** enables **fast** experiments and **straightforward** implementations of new models. It is **highly compatible** with existing machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

*Cornac is one of the frameworks recommended by [ACM RecSys 2023](https://github.com/ACMRecSys/recsys-evaluation-frameworks) for the evaluation and reproducibility of recommendation algorithms.*
