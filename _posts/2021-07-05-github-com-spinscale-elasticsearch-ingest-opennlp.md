### An Elasticsearch ingest processor to do named entity extraction using Apache OpenNLP


I wrote a [opennlp mapping plugin](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin) a couple of years ago and people asked me, why I did not update it. The main reason was, that it was a bad architectural choice as mentioned in the [openlp plugin README](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin#elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin). With the introduction of ingest processors in Elasticsearch 5.0 this problem has been resolved.

This processor is doing named/date/location/'whatever you have a model for' entity recognition and stores the output in the JSON before it is being stored.

This plugin is also intended to show you, that using gradle as a build system makes it very easy to reuse the testing facilities that elasticsearch already provides. First, you can run regular tests, but by adding a rest test, the plugin will be packaged and unzipped against elasticsearch, allowing you to execute a real end-to-end test, by just adding a java test class.
