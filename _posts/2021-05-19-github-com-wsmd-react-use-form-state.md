### ðŸ“„ React hook for managing forms and inputs state


Managing form state in React can be a bit unwieldy sometimes. There are [plenty of great solutions](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react%20forms&ranking=popularity) already available that make managing forms state a breeze. However, many of those solutions are opinionated, packed with tons of features that may end up not being used, and/or require shipping a few extra bytes!

Luckily, the recent introduction of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and the ability to write custom hooks have enabled new possibilities when it comes sharing state logic. Form state is no exception!

`react-use-form-state` is a small React Hook that attempts to [simplify managing form state](#examples), using the native form input elements you are familiar with!
