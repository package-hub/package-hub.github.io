### The future Redmine you can get today — yet another distribution of a flexible project management software named Redmine


RedMica is yet another distribution of [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/), a great open source project management software.

The main aim of RedMica is to quickly deliver new Redmine features that have already been in the repository but have not yet been officially released. We, Far End Technologies Corporation, are using RedMica in our Redmine hosting service [My Redmine](https://hosting.redmine.jp/).
