### Port of the Java Content Repository (JCR) to PHP.


This repository contains interfaces for the PHPCR standard.

The [JSR-283](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=283) specification defines an
API for a Content Repository (CR). The PHP Content Repository Interfaces aims
to provide that API in PHP. PHPCR is part of JSR-333, the next version of the
Java Content Repository.

There is a bunch of information here: http://phpcr.github.io
