This library allows to use Material steppers inside Android applications.

Quoting the [documentation](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/steppers.html):

>Steppers display progress through a sequence by breaking it up into multiple logical and numbered steps.

All of the code & features mentioned in [Getting started](#getting-started) and [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage) are showcased in the sample app.
Moreover, you can find there other examples, e.g. how to persist state on rotation, display errors, change whether the user can go to the next step, etc. So please have a look!
