### WordPress-like actions and filters for Laravel


Actions are pieces of code you want to execute at certain points in your code. Actions never return anything but merely serve as the option to hook in to your existing code without having to mess things up.

Filters are made to modify entities. They always return some kind of value. By default they return their first parameter and you should too.
