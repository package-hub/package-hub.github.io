### Training RNNs as Fast as CNNs (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755)

SRU++, a new SRU variant, is released. [[tech report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12459.pdf)] [[blog](https://www.asapp.com/blog/reducing-the-high-cost-of-training-nlp-models-with-sru/)]

The experimental code and SRU++ implementation are available on [the dev branch](https://github.com/asappresearch/sru/tree/3.0.0-dev/experiments/srupp_experiments) which will be merged into master later.
