### The Rails asset pipeline replacement for picky front-end developers


This initial release assumes you have been using Grunt in non-Rails apps and would like to start using it in Rails as well. It uses Bower for dependency management, [RequireJS](http://www.requirejs.org/) for JavaScript modules and Sass for CSS. If you use alternatives to these tools, we'd love to [hear from you][issue].
