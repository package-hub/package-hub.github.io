### A fork of the Home Assistant SmartThings Integration. This adds better support for Samsung OCF Devices.

A fork of the Home Assistant SmartThings Integration. This adds better support for Samsung OCF Devices.

This current integration is not being updated, only fixed if HA update breaks it!

Due to the immense interest to this integration I would like to build a new one that runs alongside the official Smartthings integration. This current integration is not maintainable since it was only meant for minor tweaks for myself adding missing functionality which the basic Smartthings API does not provide.
I have no need for this new integration myself so I would be asking money for it and would be releasing it closed source until I have gathered 2000â‚¬ from the integration. After that I would be releasing it as open source.
