### Python interface for Parrot Drones

Python interface for Parrot Drones

pyparrot was designed and implemented by Dr. Amy McGovern to program Parrot Mambo and Parrot Bebop 2
drones using python.  This interface was developed to teach K-20 STEM concepts
(programming, math, and more) by programming a drone to fly autonomously.
Anyone can use it who is interested in autonomous drone programming!
