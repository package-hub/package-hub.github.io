### a static analysis tool for finding vulnerabilities in C/C++ source code


This is "flawfinder" by [David A. Wheeler](mailto:dwheeler@dwheeler.com).

Flawfinder is a simple program that scans C/C++ source code and reports
potential security flaws.  It can be a useful tool for examining software
for vulnerabilities, and it can also serve as a simple introduction to
static source code analysis tools more generally.  It is designed to
be easy to install and use.  Flawfinder supports the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) and is officially CWE-Compatible.
