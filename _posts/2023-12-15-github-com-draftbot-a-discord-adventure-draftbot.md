### A Discord adventure bot that speaks english and french


_Before creating your own instance, please note that you can add the bot to your server through the link available on
the bot's discord_

**If you decide to work on the creation of your own instance of the bot, you are supposed to have a minimum of computer
skills. Bot support team will prioritize players of the main instance and will only provide very limited assistance. We
will fix bugs you report, but we will not teach you how to code a discord bot.**

Please do not copy and paste the commands we provide in this readme without :
- Understanding the command
- Replacing the relevant parts with your data
- Having read the whole document

**Only the code available in the "release" tab is considered "stable".**
