### A simple Socialite implementation for Laravel Jetstream.


Socialstream is a third-party package for [Laravel Jetstream](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream). It replaces the published authentication and profile scaffolding provided by Laravel Jetstream, with scaffolding that has support for [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite).

If you are unfamiliar with Laravel Socialite, it is strongly advised that you take a look at the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite).
