### A theme component with a gallery shortcode for the static site generator hugo.


This is a theme component for Hugo.

This component contains a shortcode to include a gallery in your .md files.

The gallery is rendered using autogenerated thumbnails arranged in a
[grid](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/). With a click on the images
a [lightbox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) is opened and all images can be
viewed full screen.
