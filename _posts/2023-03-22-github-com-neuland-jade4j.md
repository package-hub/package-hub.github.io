## [jade4j](https://github.com/neuland/jade4j)

### a pug implementation written in Java (formerly known as jade)

In alignment with the javascript template engine we renamed jade4j to pug4j. You will find it under https://github.com/neuland/pug4j
This is also a new release which supports almost the entire pug 2 syntax.

Please report pug4j issues in the new repository.
