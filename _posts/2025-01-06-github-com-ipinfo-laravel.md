### Official Laravel client library for IPinfo API (IP geolocation and other types of IP data)


This is the official Laravel client library for the [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) IP address API, allowing you to look up your own IP address, or get any of the following details for an IP:
 - [IP geolocation](https://ipinfo.io/ip-geolocation-api) (city, region, country, postal code, latitude, and longitude)
 - [ASN details](https://ipinfo.io/asn-api) (ISP or network operator, associated domain name, and type, such as business, hosting, or company)
 - [Company information](https://ipinfo.io/ip-company-api) (the name and domain of the business that uses the IP address)
 - [Carrier details](https://ipinfo.io/ip-carrier-api) (the name of the mobile carrier and MNC and MCC for that carrier if the IP is used exclusively for mobile traffic)

Check all the data we have for your IP address [here](https://ipinfo.io/what-is-my-ip).
