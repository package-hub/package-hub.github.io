### An application that lets you make specific requests to the LCU api to change how your profile looks


This project is not maintained anymore. Thank you to everyone who enjoyed it!

This application shows how data sent to the LCU can be modified or read to change visual stuff like, icon, background, hovercard, or read data such as profile data, friends, and more.
