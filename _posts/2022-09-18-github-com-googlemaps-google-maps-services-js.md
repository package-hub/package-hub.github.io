### Node.js client library for Google Maps API Web Services


This library is designed for server-side Node.js applications. Attempting to use it client-side, in either the browser or any other environment like React Native, may in some cases work, but mostly will not. Please refrain from reporting issues with these environments when attempting to use them, since **server-side Node.js applications is the only supported environment for this library**. For other environments, try the [Maps JavaScript API], which contains a comparable feature set, and is explicitly intended for use with client-side JavaScript.
