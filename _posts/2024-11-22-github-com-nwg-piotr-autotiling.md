### Script for sway and i3 to automatically switch the horizontal / vertical window split orientation

This script uses the [i3ipc-python library](https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python)
to switch the layout splith/splitv depending on the currently focused window
dimensions. It works on both sway and i3 window managers.

Inspired by https://github.com/olemartinorg/i3-alternating-layout.
