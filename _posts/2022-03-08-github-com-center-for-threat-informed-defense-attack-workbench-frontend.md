### An application allowing users to explore, create, annotate, and share extensions of the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base. This repository contains an Angular-based web application providing the user interface for the ATT&CK Workbench application.


The ATT&CK Workbench is an application allowing users to **explore**, **create**, **annotate**, and **share** extensions of the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base. 

Organizations or individuals within the ATT&CK community can initialize an instance of the application to serve as the centerpiece to their own customized instance of the ATT&CK knowledge base, attaching other tools and interfaces as desired. Through the Workbench this local knowledge base can be extended with new or updated techniques, tactics, mitigations groups, and software. Finally, the ATT&CK Workbench provides means to share these extensions with the greater ATT&CK community if so desired, facilitating a greater level of collaboration within the community than is possible with current tools. 

We developed the Workbench with the ATT&CK user community in mind. If MITRE ATT&CK is at the core our organization’s security operations, you actively track threats against ATT&CK, align your defenses to ATT&CK, or plan your security investments based on ATT&CK, the Workbench is for you. The ATT&CK Workbench enables a number of important use cases within the ATT&CK community:
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Take notes on techniques, groups, and other objects to collaborate within a threat intelligence team. Update your knowledge base with new mappings as soon as new threat reports are released.
- **Defensive Planning**: Stay up to date with the evolving threat landscape by downloading new releases of ATT&CK automatically. Fill in gaps in open-source reporting by creating new groups and software and seamlessly integrate them into the existing ATT&CK knowledge base.
- **Red Teaming**: Track and manage coverage of Red Team engagements the same way you track your ATT&CK coverage.
- **Collaboration with ATT&CK and the community**: Share your custom datasets with the ATT&CK community and download datasets created by others.

This repository contains an Angular-based web application providing the user interface for the ATT&CK Workbench application, as well as the main documentation regarding its use. The ATT&CK Workbench application requires additional components for full operation. See the [install and run](#install-and-run) instructions for more details about setting up the entire project.
