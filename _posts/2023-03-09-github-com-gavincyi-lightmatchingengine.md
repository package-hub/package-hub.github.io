## [LightMatchingEngine](https://github.com/gavincyi/LightMatchingEngine)

### A very light matching engine in Python.


A light matching engine written in Python. 

The engine is a trivial object to support

* Add order - Returns the order and filled trades
* Cancel order - Returns the original order

The objective is to provide a easy interface for users on the standard
price-time priority matching algorithm among different instruments.
