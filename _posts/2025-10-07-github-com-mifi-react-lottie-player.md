## [react-lottie-player](https://github.com/mifi/react-lottie-player)

### Fully declarative React Lottie player


- Fully declarative
- Handles state changes correctly
- Does not [leak memory like lottie-web](https://github.com/mifi/react-lottie-player/issues/35) if you use repeaters
- [LottiePlayerLight](#lottieplayerlight) support (no `eval`)
- Alternative imperative API using ref (use at your own risk)
