## [client-zip](https://github.com/Touffy/client-zip)

### A client-side streaming ZIP generator


`client-zip` concatenates multiple files (e.g. from multiple HTTP requests) into a single ZIP, **in the browser**, so you can let your users download all the files in one click. It does *not* compress the files or unzip existing archives.

`client-zip` is lightweight (6.4 kB minified, 2.6 kB gzipped), dependency-free, and 40 times faster than the old JSZip.
