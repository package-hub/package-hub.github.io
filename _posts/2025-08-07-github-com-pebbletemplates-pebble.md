### Java Template Engine


Pebble is a java templating engine inspired by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/). It separates itself from the crowd with its inheritance feature and its easy-to-read syntax. It ships with built-in autoescaping for security, and it includes integrated support for internationalization.
