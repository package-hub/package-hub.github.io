### Define forms for filling data that you will be able to open from anywhere you can run JS


This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) allows you to define forms that can be opened from anywhere you can run JavaScript, so you can combine it with other plugins like [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) or [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd).
