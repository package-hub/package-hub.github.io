### Multithreaded threat Intelligence gathering built with Python3


  Do you ever wonder if there is an easier way to retrieve, store, and maintain all your threat intelligence data? Random user, meet Forager. Not all threat intel implementations require a database that is "correlating trillions of data points.." and instead, you just need a simple interface, with simple TXT files, that can pull threat data from other feeds, PDF threat reports, or other data sources, with minimal effort. With 15 pre-configured threat feeds, you can get started with threat intelligence feed management today.. Right now.. Do it!
