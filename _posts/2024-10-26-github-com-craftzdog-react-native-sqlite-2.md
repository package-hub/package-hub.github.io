### SQLite3 Native Plugin for React Native for iOS, Android, Windows and macOS.


SQLite3 Native Plugin for React Native for Android, iOS, Windows and macOS.
This plugin provides a [WebSQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/)-compatible API to store data in a react native app, by using a SQLite database on the native side.

Inspired by fantastic work done by [Nolan Lawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson/cordova-plugin-sqlite-2).
It should be a drop-in replacement for [react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage).
It works pretty well with [PouchDB](https://github.com/stockulus/pouchdb-react-native) on React Native app.
