### Dynamic versioning library and CLI

Dunamai is a Python 3.5+ library and command line tool for producing dynamic,
standards-compliant version strings, derived from tags in your version
control system. This facilitates uniquely identifying nightly or per-commit
builds in continuous integration and releasing new versions of your software
simply by creating a tag.

Dunamai is also available as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-dunamai).
