## [tenancy](https://github.com/archtechx/tenancy)

### Automatic multi-tenancy for Laravel. No code changes needed.


You won't have to change a thing in your application's code.

- :heavy_check_mark: No model traits to change database connection
- :heavy_check_mark: No replacing of Laravel classes (`Cache`, `Storage`, ...) with tenancy-aware classes
- :heavy_check_mark: Built-in tenant identification based on hostname (including second level domains)
