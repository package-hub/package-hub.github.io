## [Multilingual_Text_to_Speech](https://github.com/Tomiinek/Multilingual_Text_to_Speech)

### An implementation of Tacotron 2 that supports multilingual experiments with parameter-sharing, code-switching, and voice cloning.


We are now going to show how to run training of our multilingual Tacotron. We used a vocoder that is based on the WaveRNN model, see [this repository](https://github.com/Tomiinek/WaveRNN) for more details, or use [our pre-trained model](#vocoding).
