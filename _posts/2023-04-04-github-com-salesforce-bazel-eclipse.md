## [bazel-eclipse](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse)

### This repo holds two IDE projects. One is the Eclipse Feature for developing Bazel projects in Eclipse. The Bazel Eclipse Feature supports importing, building, and testing Java projects that are built using the Bazel build system. The other is the Bazel Java Language Server, which is a build integration for IDEs such as VS Code.


This Git repository contains two [Bazel](http://bazel.io) IDE projects.
They share a large amount of code and therefore live together here.
Both provide IDE integrations for projects built by the [Bazel](http://bazel.io) build system.
