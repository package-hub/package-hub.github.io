### Async requests-like httplib for python.

`asks` is an async `requests`-like HTTP lib, for use in conjunction with the wonderful [curio](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio) and [trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) async libs.

`asks` aims to have a mostly familiar API, using simple functions/methods like `get()` for getting and `post()` for posting.
At the heart of `asks` is a session class which makes interacting with the web in a sustained and fluid way fast, efficient, and simple. Check out the examples!
