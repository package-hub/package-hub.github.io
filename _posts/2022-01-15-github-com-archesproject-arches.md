### Arches is a web platform for creating, managing, & visualizing geospatial data.  Arches was inspired by the needs of the Cultural Heritage community, particularly the widespread need of organizations to build & manage cultural heritage inventories


Arches is a web-based, geospatial information system for cultural heritage inventory and management. Arches is purpose-built for the international cultural heritage field, and designed to record all types of immovable heritage, including archaeological sites, buildings and other historic structures, landscapes, and heritage ensembles or districts.
