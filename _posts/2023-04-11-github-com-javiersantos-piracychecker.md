## [PiracyChecker](https://github.com/javiersantos/PiracyChecker)

### An Android library that prevents your app from being pirated / cracked using Google Play Licensing (LVL), APK signature protection and more. API 14+ required.

This library applies some techniques to help protect your app's users and attempt to thwart reverse engineers and attackers. BUT, this isn't guaranteed to stop your app from getting pirated. There is no such thing as 100% security, and a determined and skilled attacker with enough time, could remove these checks from the code. The real objective here is to raise the bar out of reach of opportunist and automatic attackers.

Some of the techniques included in this library can be found [here](https://www.airpair.com/android/posts/adding-tampering-detection-to-your-android-app).
