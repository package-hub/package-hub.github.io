### Simple, readable, helpful unit tests.


Simple, readable, helpful unit tests.

* **R**eadable
* **I**solated/**I**ntegrated
* **T**horough
* **E**xplicit

RITEway forces you to write **R**eadable, **I**solated, and **E**xplicit tests, because that's the only way you can use the API. It also makes it easier to be thorough by making test assertions so simple that you'll want to write more of them.

There are [5 questions every unit test must answer](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-every-unit-test-needs-f6cd34d9836d). RITEWay forces you to answer them.

1. What is the unit under test (module, function, class, whatever)?
2. What should it do? (Prose description)
3. What was the actual output?
4. What was the expected output?
5. How do you reproduce the failure?
