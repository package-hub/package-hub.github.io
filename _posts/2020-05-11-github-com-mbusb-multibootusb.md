What is multibootusb?
---------------------

MultiBootUSB is a cross platform* software/utility to create multi boot live Linux on a removable USB disk.
It is similar to UNetbootin but many distros can be installed, provided you have enough space on the disk.
MultiBootUSB also provides an option to uninstall distro(s) at any time, if you wish.

* Only works on windows and linux
