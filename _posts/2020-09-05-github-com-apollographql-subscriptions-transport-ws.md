### :arrows_clockwise: A WebSocket client + server for GraphQL subscriptions


**(Work in progress!)**

A GraphQL WebSocket server and client to facilitate GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions over WebSocket.

> `subscriptions-transport-ws` is an extension for GraphQL, and you can use it with any GraphQL client and server (not only Apollo).

See [GitHunt-API](https://github.com/apollostack/GitHunt-API) and [GitHunt-React](https://github.com/apollostack/GitHunt-React) for an example server and client integration.
