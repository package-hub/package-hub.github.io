### Electronic vote system, version 1.


CHVote aims to be an opensource, publicly owned evoting system. It is the result of the collaboration
between the Geneva State Chancellery and the Geneva IT Department.

CHVote is currently used by 4 cantons in Switzerland: Basel-City, Bern, Geneva and Luzern, either for
votations or elections.
