### Sensu Chef cookbook.


This cookbook provides custom resources and service recipes to install and configure
[Sensu](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/wiki), a monitoring framework.

The custom resources provide building blocks for creating a monitoring
cookbook specific to your environment (wrapper). **Without such a
wrapper, no Sensu configuration files will be created for your nodes.**

An example wrapper cookbook can be found [HERE](https://github.com/portertech/chef-monitor).
