### Bmg, Alf's successor, A Ruby Relational Algebra


Bmg is a relational algebra implemented as a ruby library. It implements the
[Relation as First-Class Citizen](http://www.try-alf.org/blog/2013-10-21-relations-as-first-class-citizen)
paradigm contributed with [Alf](http://www.try-alf.org/) a few years ago.

Bmg can be used to query relations in memory, from various files, SQL databases,
and any data source that can be seen as serving relations. Cross data-sources
joins are supported, as with Alf. For differences with Alf, see a section
further down this README.
