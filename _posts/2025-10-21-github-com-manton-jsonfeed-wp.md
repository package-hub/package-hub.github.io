## [jsonfeed-wp](https://github.com/manton/jsonfeed-wp)

### WordPress plugin to add a JSON Feed to your site.


Adds a JSON Feed to your WordPress site by adding `/feed/json` to any URL.

The JSON Feed format is a pragmatic syndication format, like RSS and Atom, but with one big difference: it's JSON instead of XML. Learn more at [jsonfeed.org](http://jsonfeed.org/).
