### Use dropdowns in Django admin list filter


A Django admin filter implementation that renders as a dropdown.

If you have more than ten values for a field that you want to filter by in
Django admin, the filtering sidebar gets long, cluttered and hard to use.

This app contains the `DropdownFilter` class that renders as a drop-down in the
filtering sidebar to avoid this problem.
