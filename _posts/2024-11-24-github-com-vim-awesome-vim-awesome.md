### Awesome Vim plugins from across the universe


Vim Awesome wants to be a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date directory of
Vim plugins.

Many recent Vim plugins are announced on Hacker News or specialized boards, and
have since become widely used. But how does a new user find out about these? We
wanted to solve that problem and others with Vim Awesome â€” an open-sourced
community resource for discovering new and popular Vim plugins.
