### Small library to parse plain text email content


EmailReplyParser is a small library to parse plain text email content.
See the rocco-documented source code for specifics on how it works.

This is what GitHub uses to display comments that were created from
email replies.  This code is being open sourced in an effort to
crowdsource the quality of our email representation.

See the [Ruby docs][rubydocs] for more information.
