### ISO 3166-1 country lists merged with their UN Geoscheme regional codes in ready-to-use JSON, XML, CSV data sets


These lists are the result of merging data from two sources, the Wikipedia [ISO 3166-1 article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Officially_assigned_code_elements) for alpha and numeric country codes, and the [UN Statistics](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview) site for countries' regional, and sub-regional codes. In addition to countries, it includes dependent territories.

The [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) site provides partial data (capitalised and sometimes stripped of non-latin ornamentation), but sells the complete data set as a Microsoft Access 2003 database. Other sites give you the numeric and character codes, but there appeared to be no sites that included the associated UN-maintained regional codes in their data sets. I scraped data from the above two websites that is all publicly available already to produce some ready-to-use complete data sets that will hopefully save someone some time who had similar needs.
