SpyGuard is a forked and enhanced version of [TinyCheck](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/TinyCheck), developed by the same author when he was working at Kaspersky. SpyGuard's main objective is to detect signs of compromise by monitoring network flows transmitted by a device. 

As it uses WiFi, SpyGuard can be used against a wide range of devices, such as smartphones, laptops, IOTs or workstations. To do its job, the analysis engine of SpyGuard is using Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), anomaly detection and is supported by [Suricata](https://suricata.io).
