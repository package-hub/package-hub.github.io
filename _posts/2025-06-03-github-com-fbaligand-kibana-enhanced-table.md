### Kibana visualization like a Data Table, but with enhanced features like computed columns, filter bar, and “Split Cols” bucket


This project is a Kibana plugin that provides two visualizations:
- **Enhanced Table:** same than Data Table, but with enhanced features like computed columns, filter bar and pivot table.
- **Document Table (NEW):** same thing than 'Enhanced Table' visualization, but for single documents (not aggregations). It especially allows to have enhanced features compared to a saved search (custom column labels, custom hits size, custom pagination, computed columns and filter bar).
