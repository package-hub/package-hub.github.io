### Adds the react-hot-loader to your create-react-app via react-app-rewired


Add the [`react-hot-loader`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) to your `create-react-app` app via [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

Because who wants their app, state, and styles automatically reloading all the time?
