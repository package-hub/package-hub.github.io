### :fire: Meteor Blaze is a powerful library for creating live-updating user interfaces


Blaze is a powerful library for creating user interfaces by writing reactive HTML templates.  Compared to using a combination of traditional templates and jQuery, Blaze eliminates the need for all the "update logic" in your app that listens for data changes and manipulates the DOM.  Instead, familiar template directives like ``{{#if}}`` and ``{{#each}}`` integrate with [Tracker's](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/master/packages/tracker) "transparent reactivity" and [Minimongo's](https://meteor.com/mini-databases) database cursors so that the DOM updates automatically.
