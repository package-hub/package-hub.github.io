### rubex - A Ruby-like language for writing Ruby C extensions.


Rubex is a Ruby-like language for writing Ruby C extensions.

Rubex is a language that makes writing CRuby C extensions as simple as writing Ruby. It does this by providing a syntax that is the perfect blend of the elegance of Ruby and the power of C. Rubex compiles to C and implicitly interfaces with the Ruby VM in a manner that is completely transparent to the programmer.

Rubex keeps you happy even when writing C extensions.
