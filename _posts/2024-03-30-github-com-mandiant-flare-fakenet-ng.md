The information in the NBI summary table is presented in a tabular format and includes the following details:

 * Select: Clicking on the checkbox selects the corresponding NBI. You can select multiple NBIs across different or the same protocols. The entire row can also be selected by clicking anywhere within the row. Selected NBIs can be copied using the "Copy Selected NBIs" button.

 * NBI: This cell represents the actual captured NBI. It includes commands, parameters, URIs, and other significant activity generated by the client against the listener. This cell summarizes malware behavior for better understanding.

 * Additional Information: This cell provides extra information about each NBI request such as the transport layer protocol used, destination IP, port, and SSL encryption.

 * Actions: This cell allows you to perform actions on individual NBIs. Currently, only copying is supported. Clicking the copy button copies the specific NBI cell data in a markdown format suitable for creating reports.
