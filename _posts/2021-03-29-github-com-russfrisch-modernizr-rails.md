### Gem wrapper to include the Modernizr.js library via the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline.


The modernizr-rails gem will include the [Modernizr.js](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) library into your `Rails 3.1+` app via the asset pipeline. This gem is bundled with the last tagged release version from the [Modernizr GitHub repo](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr), which is minified by the Rails Assets Pipeline for you automatically. If you need custom feature detection tests, consider the [Custom feature detection tests](#custom-feature-detection-tests) section in this README.
