## [cmb2-attached-posts](https://github.com/CMB2/cmb2-attached-posts)

### Custom field for CMB2 for attaching posts to a page.


Follow the example in [`example-field-setup.php`](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2-attached-posts/blob/master/example-field-setup.php) for a demonstration. The example assumes you have both CMB2 and this extension in your mu-plugins directory. If you're using CMB2 installed as a plugin, remove [lines 6-9 of the example](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2-attached-posts/blob/master/example-field-setup.php#L6-L9).
