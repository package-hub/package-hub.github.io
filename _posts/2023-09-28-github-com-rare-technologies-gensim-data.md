## [gensim-data](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data)

### Data repository for pretrained NLP models and NLP corpora.


Research datasets regularly disappear, change over time, become obsolete or come without a sane implementation to handle the data format reading and processing.

For this reason, [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) launched its own dataset storage, committed to long-term support, a sane standardized usage API and focused on datasets for **unstructured text processing** (no images or audio). This [Gensim-data](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data) repository serves as that storage.

**There's no need for you to use this repository directly**. Instead, simply install Gensim and use its download API (see the Quickstart below). It will "talk" to this repository automagically.

ðŸ’¡ When you use the Gensim download API, all data is stored in your `~/gensim-data` home folder.
