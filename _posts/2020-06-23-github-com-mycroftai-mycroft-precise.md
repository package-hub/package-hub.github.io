### A lightweight, simple-to-use, RNN wake word listener


*A lightweight, simple-to-use, RNN wake word listener.*

Precise is a wake word listener. Like its name suggests,
a wake word listener's job is to continually listen to
sounds and speech around the device, and activate when
the sounds or speech match a wake word. Unlike other machine
learning hotword detection tools, Mycroft Precise is fully open
source. Take a look at a [comparison here][comparison].
