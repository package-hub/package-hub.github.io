### Decentralized P2P exchange built on Monero and Tor


Haveno (pronounced ha‧ve‧no) is a platform for people who want to exchange [Monero](https://getmonero.org) for fiat currencies like EUR, GBP and USD or other cryptocurrencies, like BTC, ETH, BCH .

Main features:

- All communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on Haveno will happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: Haveno provides arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but we will never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because we don't need it. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Monero network.

- The revenue generated by Haveno will be managed by an entity called Council (more info soon), composed by members of the Monero/Haveno community, not the Haveno Core Team and will be used to **fund Haveno and Monero** development.
