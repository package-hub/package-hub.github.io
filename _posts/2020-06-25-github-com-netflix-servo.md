### Netflix Application Monitoring Library


This project receives minimal maintenance to keep software that relies on it working. There
is no active development or planned feature improvement. For any new projects it is recommended
to use the [Spectator] library instead.

For more details see the [Servo comparison] page in the Spectator docs.
