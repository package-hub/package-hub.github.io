### Generative Flow Networks


Implementation for [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04399), submitted to NeurIPS 2021 (also check this high-level [blog post](http://folinoid.com/w/gflownet)).

This is a minimum working version of the code used for the paper, which is extracted from the internal repository of the [Mila Molecule Discovery](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/exascale-search-of-molecules/) project. Original commits are lost here, but the credit for this code goes to [@bengioe](https://github.com/bengioe), [@MJ10](https://github.com/MJ10) and [@MKorablyov](https://github.com/MKorablyov/) (see paper).
