## [mad-location-manager](https://github.com/maddevsio/mad-location-manager)

### Mad Location Manager is a library for GPS and Accelerometer data "fusion" with Kalman filter 


This module helps to increase GPS coordinates accuracy and also:
* reduces the errors in route tracking;
* decreases the noise from Low-class smartphones;
* excludes sharp «jumps» to the points remote from a real route;
* eliminates additional distance when the object is motionless;
* filters errors duу to the short-term loss of GPS-signal.
