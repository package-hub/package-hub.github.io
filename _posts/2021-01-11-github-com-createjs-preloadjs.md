## [PreloadJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/PreloadJS)

### PreloadJS makes preloading assets & getting aggregate progress events easier in JavaScript. It uses XHR2 when available, and falls back to tag-based loading when not.


PreloadJS is a library to make working with asset preloading easier. It provides a consistent API for loading different
file types, automatic detection of XHR (XMLHttpRequest) availability with a fallback to tag-base loading, composite
progress events, and a plugin model to assist with preloading in other libraries such as [SoundJS](http://www.createjs.com/soundjs/).
