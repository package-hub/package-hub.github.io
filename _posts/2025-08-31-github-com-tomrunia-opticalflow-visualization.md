### Python optical flow visualization following Baker et al. (ICCV 2007) as used by the MPI-Sintel challenge


Python port of the optical flow visualization: [people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/OpticalFlow/](https://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/OpticalFlow/).
This implementation is based on the color wheel presented in:

```
S. Baker, D. Scharstein, J. Lewis, S. Roth, M. J. Black, and R. Szeliski.
A database and evaluation methodology for optical flow.
In Proc. IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2007.
