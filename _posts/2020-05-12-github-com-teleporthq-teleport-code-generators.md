## [teleport-code-generators](https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators)

### A collection of code generators for modern JavaScript applications

We have **official** component generators for [a couple of popular web frontend frameworks](https://docs.teleporthq.io/component-generators/flavors.html), but we are actively working on supporting mobile application with `react-native`. Check out the [official docs](https://docs.teleporthq.io/component-generators/) for an in depth understanding of the architecture behind the component generators.

All the component generators are exposing an instance of the `teleport-component-generator` package. You can also install this package and build your own generator with [plugins](https://docs.teleporthq.io/component-generators/plugins.html), [mappings](https://docs.teleporthq.io/component-generators/mappings.html) and [postprocessors](https://docs.teleporthq.io/component-generators/post-processors.html).

In the docs, you'll find a complete guide on how to [build your custom component generator](https://docs.teleporthq.io/guides/custom-component-generator.html).
