This textbook provides an in-depth introduction to software design, with a focus on object-oriented design, and using the Java programming language. Compared with other resources for learning software design, this material is intended to have the following features:

* **Concrete:** The concepts presented are worked down to a level where they are directly applied in source code. For this reason, a minimum level of Java programming proficiency is necessary. It is important to note that the Java programming language is the learning tool that allows me to illustrate and discuss various design concepts: it is not the subject being taught. Learning software design in-depth requires the use of a programming language, but the knowledge gained is expected translate easily to other languages. This being said, we might as well choose a mature, free, and well-supported language. Translation of the material to use [Plankalk&uuml;l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl) is left as an exercise.
* **Narrative:** This text follows a narrative style that links design problems, concepts, and solutions into a cohesive package. This is in contrast to reference material such as design pattern catalogs or API documentation.
* **Foundational:** *To the extent possible*, this material attempts to be independent from any specific technological solution, and in particular software application frameworks. Frameworks are invaluable for realistic development, but their continual evolution means that idiosyncratic knowledge required to use them has a short expectation of usefulness. Rather, this text focuses on general principles and techniques that underlie most frameworks.
