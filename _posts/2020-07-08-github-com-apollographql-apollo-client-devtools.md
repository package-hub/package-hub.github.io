### Apollo Client browser developer tools.


[Download for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/apollo-developer-tools/) | [Download for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm)

This repository contains the Apollo DevTools extension for Chrome & Firefox.

If you are running Apollo Client 2.0, the dev tools require at least `apollo-client@2.0.0-rc.2` and `react-apollo@2.0.0-beta.0`, and you must be running at least version 2.0.5 of the dev tools themselves.

If you are running Apollo Client 3.0, you must be running at least version 2.3.1 of the dev tools.

The devtools no longer work with Apollo Client 1.0, but upgrading should be relatively easy! If it isn't, please reach out on the [Apollo Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/apollo)
