## [phashion](https://github.com/westonplatter/phashion)

### Ruby wrapper around pHash, the perceptual hash library for detecting duplicate multimedia files

Because of this complexity, it is possible the gem install will fail on your
platform. Phashion has been tested on:

* Mac OSX 10.6
* Mac OSX 10.9
* Ubuntu 8.04
* Ubuntu 12.04

Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/westonplatter/phashion/issues/) if you have installation problems.
