*Simple and intuitive, powerful and extensible, lightning fast*

*For templated content in the browser or on Node.js (with Express 4, Hapi and Browserify integration)*

**JsRender** is a light-weight but powerful templating engine, highly extensible, and optimized for high-performance rendering, without DOM dependency. It is designed for use in the browser or on Node.js, with or without jQuery.

**[JsRender](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender)** and **[JsViews](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews)** together provide the next-generation implementation of the official jQuery plugins *[JQuery Templates](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl)*, and *[JQuery Data Link](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-datalink)* -- and supersede those libraries.
