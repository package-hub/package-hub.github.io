## [authentication-zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/authentication-zero)

### An authentication system generator for Rails applications. 


The purpose of authentication zero is to generate a pre-built authentication system into a rails application (web or api-only) that follows both security and rails best practices. By generating code into the user's application instead of using a library, the user has complete freedom to modify the authentication system so it works best with their app.
