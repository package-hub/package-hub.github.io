### A composer package to verify if a password was previously used in a breach using Have I Been Pwned API.


To increase security of users on your system, I started building a client for [@TroyHunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt)'s [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API v2 that will check if a given password was already used in a breach. Many thanks to Mr. Troy Hunt for providing us this service.
