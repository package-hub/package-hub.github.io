### Compile high-level code into Minecraft commands


Command Block Language (CBL) is a C++ inspired programming language specifically designed for Minecraft commands.

CBL has been designed to abstract away from commands to the point where you don't need to consider the underlying mechanics.

The syntax is similar to C++ in a lot of ways. It also takes from Java's idea of having no pointers in the language.
