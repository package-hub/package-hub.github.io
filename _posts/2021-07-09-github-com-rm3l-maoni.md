### Lightweight library for collecting and handling user feedback from within Android applications.


While working on a new version of [DD-WRT Companion](https://ddwrt-companion.app/), 
one of my Android apps, I needed a simple yet pleasant way to collect user feedback, 
along with some contextual information.
I experimented with a simple dialog, then tried a bunch of other libraries, 
but could not find one with screenshot capturing capabilities, not vendor lock-in, 
and which is almost a no-brainer as to integrating with any remote services.
I was also looking for screen capture highlight / blackout capabilities, as in use for issue reporting in 
several apps from Google.

So as a way to give back to the Open Source community, 
I decided to create Maoni as a separate library project.

By the way, as a side note, Maoni is a Swahili word for comments or opinions.
