### An object oriented approach to generating OpenAPI specs, implemented in PHP.


An object oriented approach to generating OpenAPI specs, implemented in PHP. 

You can build up your API spec using immutable PHP classes, and then export the 
spec to JSON (or YAML with the help of another package).

This package is **dependency free** and makes heavy use of **PHP 7 features**, 
mainly being **type hints** and enabling **strict types**. This should make your 
life a lot easier when working with a good IDE that can use this information.
