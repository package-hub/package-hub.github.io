## [scant3r](https://github.com/MindPatch/scant3r)

### ScanT3r - Module based Bug Bounty Automation Tool ( use Lotus instead github.com/bugBlocker/lotus )

You should use the Lotus project (https://github.com/rusty-sec/lotus/) instead of scant3r, since scant3r had been developed with many errors that will take more time to fix and scant3r is very slow compared to Lotus.
