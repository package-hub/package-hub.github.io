### A Zend_Cache backend for Redis with full support for tags (works great with Magento)


This Zend_Cache backend allows you to use a Redis server as a central cache storage. Tags are fully supported
without the use of TwoLevels cache so this backend is great for use on a single machine or in a cluster.
Works with any Zend Framework project including all versions of Magento!
