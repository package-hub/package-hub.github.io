### Create a Windows package for your Electron app.


> Create a Windows package for your Electron app.

This tool relies on the awesome [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) framework written by [@anaisbetts](https://github.com/anaisbetts). It takes care of creating the actual package, signing it, dealing with updates, and many more things. Gotta give credit where credit is due, ya know.
