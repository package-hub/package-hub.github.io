## [osmd-audio-player](https://github.com/jimutt/osmd-audio-player)

### Audio playback extension for OpenSheetMusicDisplay. Browser based audio player for MusicXML scores.


Unoffical audio playback engine for [OpenSheetMusicDisplay](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay). Successor meant to replace my previous proof of concept player & demo at https://github.com/jimutt/osmd-playback-demo.

This player is still in a very early state and lots of breaking and non-breaking changes will most likely be introduced before the first major release. Use at your own risk!
