### OHIF zero-footprint DICOM viewer and oncology specific Lesion Tracker, plus shared extension packages


The OHIF Viewer can retrieve
and load images from most sources and formats; render sets in 2D, 3D, and
reconstructed representations; allows for the manipulation, annotation, and
serialization of observations; supports internationalization, OpenID Connect,
offline use, hotkeys, and many more features.

Almost everything offers some degree of customization and configuration. If it
doesn't support something you need, we accept pull requests and have an ever
improving Extension System.
