### System for Medical Concept Extraction and Linking


QuickUMLS (Soldaini and Goharian, 2016) is a tool for fast, unsupervised  biomedical concept extraction from medical text.
It takes advantage of [Simstring](http://www.chokkan.org/software/simstring/) (Okazaki and Tsujii, 2010) for approximate string matching.
For more details on how QuickUMLS works, we remand to our paper.

This project should be compatible with Python 3 (Python 2 is [no longer supported](https://pythonclock.org/)) and run on any UNIX system (support for Windows is experimental, please report bugs!). **If you find any bugs, please file an issue on GitHub or email the author at luca@ir.cs.georgetown.edu**.
