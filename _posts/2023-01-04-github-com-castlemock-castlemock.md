## [castlemock](https://github.com/castlemock/castlemock)

### Castle Mock is a web application that provides the functionality to mock out RESTful APIs and SOAP web services. 


**Castle Mock** can create mocked services based on WSDL, WADL, Swagger and RAML definition files. The web-services defined within the files will be mocked automatically by **Castle Mock**. Once the mocks for the web-services are created, they can be configured to mock the service or forward the request to the original endpoint. The response from the forwarded requests can be recorded automatically and used to create new mocked responses.

**Castle Mock** is completely free and open source (Apache License). It is built with Java and the application itself is deployed to an Apache Tomcat server.
