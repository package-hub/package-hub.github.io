### A simple, fast and secure PHP/AngularJS based feed and mail reader, password and bookmark manager.


A simple, fast and secure PHP/AngularJS based single user feed and mail reader, password and bookmark manager.
CacoCloud is divided into a [RESTful](https://github.com/Cacodaimon/CacoCloud/wiki/RESTful-API) PHP backend storing all data into a [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) database and an SPA frontend based on [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/). 

I have mainly written CacoCloud to fit my personal needs, but maybe it fits your needs, too.

You can find some screenshots in the [wiki](https://github.com/Cacodaimon/CacoCloud/wiki/Screenshots).
