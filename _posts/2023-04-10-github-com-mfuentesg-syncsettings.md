### Sync Settings - The cross-platform solution to keep Sublime Text configuration synchronized


Sadly, I won't able to continue with the development of SyncSettings, it will be available on package control registry but won't receive new changes.

SyncSettings has been a very challenging project and it tought me how to cope with a community and learn more about the open source world.
Thanks for all the support during this time and I hope that SyncSttings remains being so useful like it was for me.

Happy Coding!
