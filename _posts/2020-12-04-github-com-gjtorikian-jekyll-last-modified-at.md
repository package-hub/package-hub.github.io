## [jekyll-last-modified-at](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at)

### A Jekyll plugin to show the last_modified_at time of a post.


A liquid tag for Jekyll to indicate the last time a file was modified.

This plugin determines a page's last modified date by checking the last Git commit date of source files. In the event Git is not available, the file's `mtime` is used.
