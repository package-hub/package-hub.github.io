### cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics


The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. For a short intro on cBioPortal, see [these introductory slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hm0G77UklZnpQfFvywBfW2ZIsy8deKi5r1RfJarOPLg/edit?usp=sharing).

If you would like to know how to setup a private instance of the portal and/or get set up for developing, see the [documentation](https://docs.cbioportal.org). For details on contributing code changes via pull requests, see our [Contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md).
