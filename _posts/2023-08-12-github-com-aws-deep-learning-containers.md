### AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) are a set of Docker images for training and serving models in TensorFlow, TensorFlow 2, PyTorch, and MXNet.


AWS [Deep Learning Containers (DLCs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/what-is-dlc.html) 
are a set of Docker images for training and serving models in TensorFlow, TensorFlow 2, PyTorch, and MXNet. 
Deep Learning Containers provide optimized environments with TensorFlow and MXNet, Nvidia CUDA (for GPU instances), and 
Intel MKL (for CPU instances) libraries and 
are available in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). 

The AWS DLCs are used in Amazon SageMaker as the default vehicles for your SageMaker jobs such as training, inference, 
transforms etc. They've been tested for machine
learning workloads on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS services as well.

For the list of available DLC images, see [Available Deep Learning Containers Images](available_images.md). 
You can find more information on the images available in Sagemaker [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html)
