## [Meteor-Files](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files)

### 🚀 Upload files via DDP or HTTP to ☄️ Meteor server FS, AWS, GridFS, DropBox or Google Drive. Fast, secure and robust.


Stable, fast, robust, and well-maintained Meteor.js package for files management using MongoDB Collection API. Call [`.insertAsync()`](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/insertAsync.md) method to initiate a file upload and to insert new record into MongoDB collection after upload is complete. Calling [`.removeAsync()`](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/removeAsync.md) method would erase stored file and record from MongoDB Collection. And so on, no need to learn new APIs. Hackable via hooks and events. Supports uploads to AWS:S3, GridFS, Google Storage, DropBox, and other 3rd party storage.
