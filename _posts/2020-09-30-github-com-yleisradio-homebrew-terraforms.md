### Terraform version switcher and Homebrew Casks for Terraform versions


This repository includes Homebrew Casks to install multiple Terraform versions (since 0.6.6) at the same time, and a `chtf` helper to specify which one to use. `chtf` also installs the specified version automatically if needed.
