### Source for the demo app client in the Serverless Stack Guide


The [Serverless Stack Guide](http://serverless-stack.com) is a free comprehensive resource to creating full-stack serverless applications. We create a [note taking app](http://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch.

The main part of the guide uses [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack). We also have an alternative version that uses Serverless Framework. This repo connects to the [Serverless Framework version of the backend](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-api).
