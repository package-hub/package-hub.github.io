## [modmailbot](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot)

### Modmail Bot is a bot for Discord that makes it easier for users to contact moderators and admins for help.

Modmail Bot is a bot for [Discord](https://discord.com/) that allows users to DM the bot to contact the server's moderators/staff
without messaging them individually or pinging them publically on the server.
These DMs get relayed to modmail *threads*, channels where staff members can reply to and talk with the user.
To the user, the entire process happens in DMs with the bot.

Inspired by Reddit's modmail system.

**âš  Note on updating to v3.0.0:** If you're currently using a *very* old version of the bot, from before February 2018, you'll first need to update to v2.30.1 and run the bot once before updating to v3.0.0.

Always take a backup of your `db/data.sqlite` file before updating the bot.
