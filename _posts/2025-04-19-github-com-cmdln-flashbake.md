### Scripts to gather information for including in version history comments and to make using source control a bit simpler for non-technical projects.


Flashbake is about helping writers use Git version control to archive the evolution of their work. 
This can include the initial creation of the work, edits to the work, as well as metadata surrounding the writing process. 

The metadata is configurable and pulls in information from the user's lifelog such as recent social media posts, blog posts, music listening, current weather, location, and more.
It then commits that metadata and textual changes to an archive at set intervals.

As [Cory Doctorow describes it](https://craphound.com/news/2009/02/13/flashbake-free-version-control-for-writers-using-git/) Flashbake is about recording, "Where am I, what’s it like there, and what am I thinking about?”
