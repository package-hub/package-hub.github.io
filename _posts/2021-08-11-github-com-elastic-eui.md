### Elastic UI Framework ðŸ™Œ


> The Elastic UI Framework is a collection of React UI components for quickly building user interfaces

You should check out our [living style guide][docs], which contains many examples of components in the EUI framework aesthetic, and how to use them in your products. We also have a [FAQ][faq] that covers common usage questions.
