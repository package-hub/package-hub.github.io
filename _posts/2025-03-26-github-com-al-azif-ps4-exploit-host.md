### Easy Exploit Hosting


This is an easy way for anyone to host their own exploit for the PS4/PS5/Vita/Wii/Switch/etc on their LAN. Features include:

- Hosts your choice of exploit
- Allows caching of exploits for offline use (Device dependant)
- Sends your choice of payload after a successful exploit
- Blocks update/telemetry domains from resolving
- Serves a specific firmware update to your device (Device dependant)
- Server side application works on just about every platform
- Static Website builder. Compiles the host into a static website to run on HTTP server of your choice (You lose some features using this method, DNS, updater, etc)

If you do not want to host the package yourself you can use my remote DNS. See the `Using remote DNS` section below.
