### Authentication Module for django rest auth


If you need to debug a test locally and if you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed:

simply run the ``./docker-run-tests.sh`` script and it will run the test suite in every Python /
Django versions.

You could also simply run regular ``tox`` in the root folder as well, but that would make testing the matrix of
Python / Django versions a bit more tricky.
