### Real picture tag polyfill, to use responsive images today!


A Responsive Images approach that you can use today that uses the **[real `picture` element](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-html-picture-element-20130226/)** along with children `source` elements with `media`, `src` and `srcset` attributes.
