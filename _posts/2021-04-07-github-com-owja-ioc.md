### :unicorn: lightweight (<1kb) inversion of control javascript library for dependency injection written in typescript


* Similar syntax to InversifyJS
* Can be used without decorators
* Less Features but **straight forward**
* Can bind dependencies as **classes**, **factories** and **static values**
* Supports binding in **singleton scope**
* **Cached** - Resolves only once in each dependent class by default
* **Cache can switched off** directly at the inject decorator
* Made with **unit testing** in mind
* Supports dependency **rebinding** and container **snapshots** and **restores**
* **Lightweight** - Below 1kb brotli/gzip compressed
* Does **NOT** need reflect-metadata which size is around 50 kb
* 100% written in **Typescript**
