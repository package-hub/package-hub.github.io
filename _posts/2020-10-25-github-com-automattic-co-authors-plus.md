### Multiple bylines and Guest Authors for WordPress


Assign multiple bylines to posts, pages, and custom post types via a search-as-you-type input box. Co-authored posts appear on a co-author's archive page and in their feed. Co-authors may edit the posts they are associated with, and co-authors who are contributors may only edit posts if they have not been published (as is core behaviour).

Add writers as bylines without creating WordPress user accounts. Simply [create a guest author profile](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/add-guest-bylines-to-your-content-with-co-authors-plus/) for the writer and assign the byline as you normally would.

On the frontend, use the [Co-Authors Plus template tags](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/incorporate-co-authors-plus-template-tags-into-your-theme/) to list co-authors anywhere you'd normally list the author.

This plugin is an almost complete rewrite of the [Co-Authors](https://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors/) plugin originally developed by Weston Ruter (2007). The original plugin was inspired by the '[Multiple Authors](https://txfx.net/2005/08/16/new-plugin-multiple-authors/)' plugin by Mark Jaquith (2005).
