## [autonomous-learning-library](https://github.com/cpnota/autonomous-learning-library)

### A PyTorch library for building deep reinforcement learning agents.


The `autonomous-learning-library` is an object-oriented deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library for PyTorch.
The goal of the library is to provide the necessary components for quickly building and evaluating novel reinforcement learning agents,
as well as providing high-quality reference implementations of modern DRL algorithms.
The full documentation can be found at the following URL: [https://autonomous-learning-library.readthedocs.io](https://autonomous-learning-library.readthedocs.io).
