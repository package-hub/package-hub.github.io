### React Native wrapper for the Google Cast SDK


This library wraps the native Google Cast SDK for iOS and Android, providing a unified JavaScript interface.

> This is a complete rewrite of the library. If you're still using v1, please check the [v1 branch](https://github.com/react-native-google-cast/react-native-google-cast/tree/v1).

> There's a yet new version in the works that closely resembles the native APIs. All new feature requests will be directed there. If you want to check it out, visit the [v4 branch](https://github.com/react-native-google-cast/react-native-google-cast/tree/v4).
