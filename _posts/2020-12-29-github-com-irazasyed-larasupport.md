### ðŸ“¦ Adds Laravel Packages Support to Lumen and Vendor Publish Artisan Command.


> **Laravel Package Support for Lumen:** Makes Lumen compatible with Laravel Packages. You can use any Laravel Packages in Lumen by installing **Larasupport** Package.
>
> Laravel Packages make use of various global helpers that are not available in Lumen core by default which prevents us from using any Laravel Package in Lumen.
>
> This package adds the missing pieces to make Lumen compatible along with the support for `vendor:publish` artisan command and other features.
