### A simple Android webbrowser based on webview.


FOSS Browser uses the latest [Material You](https://m3.material.io/) design libraries. Following system day/night mode and a wallpaper based theme are just two features of this new library. The UI is optimized for one-hand-use. All UI-elements are at the bottom of the screen.


_More features:_

- Play audio on background.
- Keep screen on.
- Open links in background.
- Restore tabs on restart.
