### Let's Encrypt/ACME Command Line client written in PHP


Acme PHP provides several major improvements over the default clients:
-   Acme PHP comes by nature as a single binary file: a single download and you are ready to start working ;
-   Acme PHP is based on a configuration file instead command line arguments.
    Thus, the configuration is much more expressive and the same setup is used at every renewal ;
-   Acme PHP is very extensible it to create the certificate files structure you need for your webserver.
    It brings several default formatters to create classical file structures
    (nginx, nginx-proxy, haproxy, etc.) but you can very easily create your own if you need to ;
-   Acme PHP follows a strict BC policy preventing errors in your scripts or CRON even if you update it (see
    [the Backward Compatibility policy of Acme PHP](#backward-compatibility-policy) for more informations) ;
