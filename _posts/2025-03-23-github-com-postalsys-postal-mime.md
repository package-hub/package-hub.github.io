### Email parser for browser and serverless environments


**postal-mime** is an email parsing library that runs in browser environments (including Web Workers) and serverless functions (like Cloudflare Email Workers). It takes in a raw email message (RFC822 format) and outputs a structured object containing headers, recipients, attachments, and more.

> **Tip**  
> PostalMime is developed by the makers of [EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=imapflow&utm_medium=readme-link)â€”a self-hosted email gateway that provides a REST API for IMAP and SMTP servers and sends webhooks whenever something changes in registered accounts.
