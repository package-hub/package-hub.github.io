### ðŸ¦Š Test your Gitlab CI Pipelines changes locally using Docker.


Ease GitLab CI Pipelines set-up by running your jobs locally in Docker containers.

Why ? Because I did not want to commit, push, and wait for my jobs to run on the GitLab UI to figure I forgot to install `make` before running `make build`.

ðŸ“£ Disclaimer: this is a helper tool aiming to facilite the process of setting up GitLab CI Pipelines. glci **does NOT** aim to replace any other tool.
