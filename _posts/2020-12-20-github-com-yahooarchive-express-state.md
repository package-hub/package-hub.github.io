### Share configuration and state data of an Express app with the client-side via JavaScript.


Express State is designed to make it easy to share configuration and state data
from the server to the client. It can be used to share any data that needs to be
available to the client-side JavaScript code of the an app: e.g., the current
user, a CSRF token, model data, routes, etc.

Progressively enhanced Web apps can be built by rendering an app's initial state
on the server and using Express State as the conduit through which the server
passes data and control over to the client-side JavaScript code.
