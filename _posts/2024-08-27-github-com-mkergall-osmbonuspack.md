## [osmbonuspack](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack)

### A third-party library of (very) useful additional objects for osmdroid

osmdroid is a library to interact with OpenStreetMap data inside an Android application. It offers an almost full/free replacement to Android map objects: MapView, MapController, Overlays (Marker, Polyline, Polygon), etc.

This "OSMBonusPack" library complements osmdroid with (very) useful classes:

*  [Routes and Directions](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/Tutorial_1),
*  [Points of Interests](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/Tutorial_2) (directory services),
*  [Marker Clustering](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/Tutorial_3),
*  Support for [KML and GeoJSON](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/Tutorial_4) content,
*  [GroundOverlay](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/Tutorial_5), similar to its Google Maps equivalent,
*  Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding,
*  and more...

Have a look to the examples below, and to the [features](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/features). 

The [OSMNavigator](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/OSMNavigator) application demonstrates the use of these classes. This is a generic-purpose Map/Navigation tool, including a KML viewer and editor.
