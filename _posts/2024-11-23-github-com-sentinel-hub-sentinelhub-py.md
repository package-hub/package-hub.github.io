## [sentinelhub-py](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py)

### Download and process satellite imagery in Python using Sentinel Hub services.


The **sentinelhub** Python package is the official Python interface for [Sentinel Hub services](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/). It supports most of the services described in the [Sentinel Hub documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/) and any type of [satellite data collections](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/), including Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, DEM, and custom collections produced by users.

The package also provides a collection of basic tools and utilities for working with geospatial and satellite data. It builds on top of well known packages such as `numpy`, `shapely`, `pyproj`, etc. It is also a core dependency of [`eo-learn`](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn) Python package for creating geospatial data-processing workflows.

The main package resources are [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py), [documentation page](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Sentinel Hub forum](https://forum.sentinel-hub.com/).
