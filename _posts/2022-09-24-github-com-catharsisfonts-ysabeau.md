### Ysabeau: The essence of Garamond in an open-source sans-serif typeface


Ysabeau is a free type family developed by Christian Thalmann ([Catharsis Fonts][1]). It combines the time-honored and supremely readable letterforms of the Garamond legacy with the clean crispness of a low-contrast sans serif, rendering it well suited for body copy as well as display. It is open source, and all its working files (in [Glyphs][2] format) are available from this repository. If you wish to work with Ysabeau in a different font editor (which I wouldn't recommend), I can provide you with UFO versions of those files instead.

Any feedback, bug reports, test results, and suggestions for additions are very welcome. You can contact me using the [Ysabeau issue tracker][4]. 

If you like Ysabeau, please help spread the word via the social media of your choice. You might also be interested in my other typefaces on [MyFonts][1] and in my other free type family [Cormorant][3].
