### Self-hostable TikTok feed for your clips. Make a TikTok feed with your own videos


Erin is a simple and self-hostable service that enables you to view your own clips using TikTok's well-known vertical swipe feed.
[A request was made on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dogl9d/selfhost_a_site_for_short_videos_like_tiktok/)
for a self-hostable app that can show filtered videos using TikTok's interface, so I made it.
