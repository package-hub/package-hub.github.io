### An open-standards augmented reality platform for the web


An open-standards augmented reality platform for the web. Initially created to supporting creating AR web applications for [the Argon4 browser](https://app.argonjs.io), argon.js is now aimed at supporting AR in any web browser, using whatever capabilities are available on each platform.

*This software was created as part of a research project at the 
Augmented Environments Lab at Georgia Tech.  To support our research, 
we request that if you make use of this software, you let us know 
how you used it by sending mail to Blair MacIntyre (blair@cc.gatech.edu).*

If you would like to help improve Argon4 and argon.js, you can see our current and future [Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/gBsEa8eg/argon-public-roadmap).
