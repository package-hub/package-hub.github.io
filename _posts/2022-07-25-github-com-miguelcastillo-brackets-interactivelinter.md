### Interactive linting for Brackets

Brackets integration with linters such as JSHint, JSLint, ESLint, JSCS, CoffeeLint, and more! Interactive Linter runs linters as you work on your code and gives instant feedback right on your document. You can access the details of the lint report by clicking on the light bulbs on the line gutters to the right of the document, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-E` on that line.
