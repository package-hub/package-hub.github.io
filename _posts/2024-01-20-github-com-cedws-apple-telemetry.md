### Domain blocklists, IP blocklists, Little Snitch .lsrules, and cloaking files for blocking Apple telemetry

>**:warning: Looking for maintainers! https://github.com/cedws/apple-telemetry/issues/25**

Domain blocklists, IP blocklists, and cloaking files for domains that Apple devices frequently contact. DNSCloak is an excellent app capable of using these files, but it's a bit of a pain to get the blocklists onto your device. **Services such as updates, App Store, and Apple Pay will probably be blocked by this list.** You can remove entries manually, but this is tedious, so I recommend just temporarily disabling the blocklist when necessary.

Here's a vague [overview of what each domain is for](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210060).
