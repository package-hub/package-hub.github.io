### Time Series Forecasting Best Practices & Examples


Time series forecasting is one of the most important topics in data science. Almost every business needs to predict the future in order to make better decisions and allocate resources more effectively.

This repository provides examples and best practice guidelines for building forecasting solutions. The goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in forecasting algorithms to build solutions and operationalize them. Rather than creating implementations from scratch, we draw from existing state-of-the-art libraries and build additional utilities around processing and featurizing the data, optimizing and evaluating models, and scaling up to the cloud. 

The examples and best practices are provided as [Python Jupyter notebooks and R markdown files](examples) and [a library of utility functions](fclib). We hope that these examples and utilities can significantly reduce the “time to market” by simplifying the experience from defining the business problem to the development of solutions by orders of magnitude. In addition, the example notebooks would serve as guidelines and showcase best practices and usage of the tools in a wide variety of languages.
