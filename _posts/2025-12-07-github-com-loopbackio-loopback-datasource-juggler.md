### Connect Loopback to various Data Sources


An ORM/ODM that provides a common set of interfaces for interacting with databases, REST APIs, and other types of data sources. It was originally forked from [JugglingDB](https://github.com/1602/jugglingdb). 

In LoopBack 4, it is part of the `@loopback/repository` module. See [Repository page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Repository.html) in LoopBack 4 for more details.
