### A toolkit for reproducible reinforcement learning research


garage is a toolkit for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, and an accompanying library of state-of-the-art implementations built using that toolkit.

The toolkit provides wide range of modular tools for implementing RL algorithms, including:
* Composable neural network models
* Replay buffers
* High-performance samplers
* An expressive experiment definition interface
* Tools for reproducibility (e.g. set a global random seed which all components respect)
