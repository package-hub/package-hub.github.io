### Hook into advanced CSS features from native inline styles.


Hooks add CSS features to native inline styles, enabling you to apply styles
conditionally based on pseudo-classes, custom selectors, media queries, and
moreâ€”all without leaving the `style` prop. By exploiting the hidden
programmability of CSS Variables, CSS Hooks delivers a flexible CSS-in-JS
experience without runtime style injection or build steps.
