## [Repeat](https://github.com/repeats/Repeat)

### Cross-platform mouse/keyboard record/replay and automation hotkeys/macros creation, and more advanced automation features.

1. This runs on any platform that supports Java and is non [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software). AutoHotkey is written for Windows only, and AutoKey is only for Linux. Repeat works on Linux, Windows, and OSX. **The written macro can be re-used cross platforms.**
2. The only limit to your hotkey power is your knowledge of the language you write your tasks in (e.g. Java, Python or C#). You don't have to learn a new meta language provided by AutoHotkey. This allows you to leverage your expertise in the language chosen and/or the immense support from the internet.
