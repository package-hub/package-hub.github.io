### GraphQL Mesh â€” Query anything, run anywhere


The way GraphQL Mesh works is:

1. Collect API schema specifications from services
2. Create a runtime instance of fully-typed SDK for the services.
3. Convert API specs to GraphQL schema
4. Applies custom schema transformations and schema extensions
5. Creates fully-typed, single schema, GraphQL SDK to fetch data from your services.
