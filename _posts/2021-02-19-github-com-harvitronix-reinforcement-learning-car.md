### Using reinforcement learning to teach a car to avoid obstacles.


**NOTE: If you're coming here from parts 1 or 2 of the Medium posts, you want to visit the releases section and check out version 1.0.0, as the code has evolved passed that.**

This is a hobby project I created to learn the basics of reinforcement learning. It uses Python3, Pygame, Pymunk, Keras and Theanos. It employes a Q-learning (unsupervised) algorithm to learn how to move an object around a screen (drive itself) without running into obstacles.

The purpose of this project is to eventually use the learnings from the game to operate a real-life remote-control car, using distance sensors. I am carrying on that project in another GitHub repo here: https://github.com/harvitronix/rl-rc-car

This version of the code attempts to simulate the use of sensors to get us a step closer to being able to use this in the real world.
