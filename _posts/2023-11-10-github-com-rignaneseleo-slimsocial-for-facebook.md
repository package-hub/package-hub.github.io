### Light version of Facebook. Light both in the weight and in the use.



SlimSocial for Facebook is a lightweight and customizable alternative to the official Facebook app. It was originally [created in 2015](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-slimfacebook-1mb-0-permissions-t3254174) as a project to explore Android app development, but it was put on hold due to university and work commitments.

Recently, I updated the app with a new codebase using Flutter, making it more efficient and user-friendly than ever before. SlimSocial still retains its original values of lightweight design and privacy, while introducing new features, such as the ability to hide ads and a better user interface.
