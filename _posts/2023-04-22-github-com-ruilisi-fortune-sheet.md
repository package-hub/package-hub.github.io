### A drop-in javascript spreadsheet library that provides rich features like Excel and Google Sheets


The goal of `FortuneSheet` is to make a feature-rich, easy-to-configure online spreadsheet that you can use out-of-the-box.

This project is originated from [Luckysheet](https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet) and has inherited many code from it. Lots of efforts have done to translate the whole project to typescript (still in progress), and solved problems in the design of the original project.

We aim to make FortuneSheet powerful yet easy to maintain.
