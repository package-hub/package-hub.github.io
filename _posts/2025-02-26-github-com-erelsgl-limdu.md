### Machine-learning for Node.js


Limdu is a machine-learning framework for Node.js. It supports **multi-label classification**, **online learning**, and **real-time classification**. Therefore, it is especially suited for natural language understanding in dialog systems and chat-bots.

Limdu is in an "alpha" state - some parts are working (see this readme), but some parts are missing or not tested. Contributions are welcome. 

Limdu currently runs on Node.js 0.12 and later versions.
