### A supercharged SQLite library for Python

A feature-packed Python package and for utilizing SQLite in Python by [Plasticity](https://www.plasticity.ai/). It is intended to be a drop-in replacement to Python's built-in [SQLite API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html), but without any limitations. It offers unique features like [remote streaming over HTTP](#remote-streaming-over-http) and [bundling of extensions like JSON, R-Trees (geospatial indexing), and Full Text Search](#extensions). SuperSQLite is also packaged with pre-compiled native binaries for SQLite and all of its extensions for nearly every platform as to avoid any C/C++ compiler errors during install.
