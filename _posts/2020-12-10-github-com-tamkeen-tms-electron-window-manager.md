## [electron-window-manager](https://github.com/tamkeen-tms/electron-window-manager)

### A NodeJs module that handles window management for Electron (Atom Shell, previously).


> A NodeJs module for [Electron](https://electronjs.org) (Atom Shell, previously) that will help you create, control, manage and connect your application windows very easily.

Most of the applications created using Electron are one-window applications. Why only one? Maybe because we as web developers are used to building only inside the browser. But if you are to build a multi-window Electron application then you may want to have a look at this package module.
