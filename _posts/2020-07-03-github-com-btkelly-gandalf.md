### Easily notify a user with a simple alert, inform them of an optional update, and in dire situations block the user from accessing older versions of the application completely.


In the lifetime of any application there will come a time where you need to drop support for a feature, end of life a product, notify about maintenance, any number of other reasons, Gandalf is here to help!

Gandalf will easily add a check to a remote file that can notify a user with a simple alert, inform them of an optional update, and in dire situations block the user from accessing older versions of the application completely (**ex:** security vulnerability has been found).
