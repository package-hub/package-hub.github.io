## [appsmith](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith)

### Build beautiful admin panels, dashboards, and CRUD apps. Connect to any database or API. One-click docker installation.


* **5-minute setup**: Deploy Appsmith on your server, or use our cloud version to start building in 5 minutes. [Quick Start](#%EF%B8%8F-quickstart)
* **Frontend as a service**: Drag-and-drop from pre-built UI widgets like table, form, and image, to build sophisticated **dashboards** and **workflows, without writing HTML/CSS**. Write JavaScript anywhere to transform data, and dynamically control widget-properties.
* **Database CRUD**: Query & update your database directly by connecting it to the UI. Connect to **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL & more!**
* **Trigger APIs**: Connect to REST APIs to build custom apps.
* **Security**: DB Credentials are AES 256 encrypted and no data is stored by appsmith. Deploy behind your private VPC for additional security!
* **One-click deployment**: Managed deployment of your apps with a click of a button.
* **Access-control**: Assign users different roles & control who can edit / view your applications.
* **Supports OAuth**: Allow users to authenticate via Google Auth or GitHub Auth.
