### Serve static websites (SPA's) using Nest framework (node.js) ðŸ¥¦


`@nestjs/serve-static` package for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), useful to serve static content like Single Page Applications (SPA). However, if you are building MVC application or want to serve assets files (images, docs), use the `useStaticAssets()` method (read more [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mvc)) instead.
