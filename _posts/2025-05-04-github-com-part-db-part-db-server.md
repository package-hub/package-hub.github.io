### Part-DB is an Open source inventory management system for your electronic components


Part-DB is an Open-Source inventory management system for your electronic components.
It is installed on a web server and so can be accessed with any browser without the need to install additional software.

The version in this repository is a complete rewrite of the legacy [Part-DB](https://github.com/Part-DB/Part-DB)
(Version < 1.0) based on a modern framework and is the recommended version to use.

If you find a bug, please open an [Issue on GitHub,](https://github.com/Part-DB/Part-DB-server/issues) so it can be fixed
for everybody.
