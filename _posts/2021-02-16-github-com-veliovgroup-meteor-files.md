## [Meteor-Files](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files)

### üöÄ Upload files via DDP or HTTP to ‚òÑÔ∏è Meteor server FS, AWS, GridFS, DropBox or Google Drive. Fast, secure and robust.


Stable, fast, robust, and well-maintained Meteor.js package for files management using MongoDB Collection API. What does exactly this means? Calling [`.insert()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/insert.md) method would initiate a file upload and then insert new record into collection. Calling [`.remove()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/remove.md) method would erase stored file and record from MongoDB Collection. And so on, no need to learn new APIs. It's flavored with extra low-level methods like [`.unlink()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/unlink.md) and [`.write()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/write.md) for complex integrations.
