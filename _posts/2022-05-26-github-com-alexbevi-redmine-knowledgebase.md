### A knowledgebase plugin for Redmine


The Redmine Knowledgebase is still receiving pull requests and issues, but does not have an active maintainer. I (@alexbevi) stepped away a number of years ago, and Robert (@robspearman) stepped in and took over. It's been a couple years now and Robert's availability is diminished so we're on the lookout for a new steward for the project. If you're interested shoot me an email at alex@alexbevi.com.
