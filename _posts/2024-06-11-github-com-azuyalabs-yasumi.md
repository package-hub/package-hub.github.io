### The easy PHP Library for calculating holidays


Yasumi (Japanese for 'Holiday'「休み」) is the easy PHP library that helps you retrieve the dates and names of holidays and
other special celebrations from various countries/states. It is calculation and rule driven avoiding the need of a
comprehensive database.

Many services exist that can provide holiday information, however are either not entirely free or only offer limited
information. In addition, no exhaustive PHP library exists today covering a wide range of holidays and
countries. [PEAR's Date_Holidays](https://pear.php.net/package/Date_Holidays) library was a similar attempt, however it
hasn't been updated for a long time.
