### âš¡ Simplest way to organize and run command-line tasks


Do you keep opening terminals to run your scripts/commands/tasks etc,. If you have to do that everyday for same project (Example running scripts from `package.json` for multiple projects), `Ten Hands` makes it easier to organize all your tasks in one place.
You can organize tasks into projects and run them whenever you want with a click of a button.
