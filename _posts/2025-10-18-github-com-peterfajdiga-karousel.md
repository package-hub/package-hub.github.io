### Scrollable tiling Kwin script

Scrollable tiling Kwin script. Works especially well with ultrawide screens.
Use with [this](https://github.com/peterfajdiga/kwin4_effect_geometry_change) for animations.

A scrollable tiling window manager tiles windows, but it does not maximize their widths. Instead, it leaves the width of windows to the user's control.
Windows are automatically centered when possible. And when running out of width, windows can be scrolled through horizontally.

Similar window managers include [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM),
[Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri), and
[Cardboard](https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard).
