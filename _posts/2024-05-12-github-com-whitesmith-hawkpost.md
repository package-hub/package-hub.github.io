### Generate links that users can use to submit messages encrypted with your public key.


Hawkpost lets you create unique links that you can share with the person that desires to send you important information but doesn't know how to deal with PGP.

You can deploy your own server using the code from this repository or use the official server (that is running an exact copy of this repo) at [https://hawkpost.co](https://hawkpost.co).
