### Tweets metadata scraper & activity analyzer


The goal of this simple python script is to analyze a Twitter profile through its tweets by detecting:
  - Average tweet activity, by hour and by day of the week
  - Timezone and language set for the Twitter interface
  - Sources used (mobile application, web browser, ...)
  - Geolocations
  - Most used hashtags, most retweeted users and most mentioned users
  - Friends analysis based on most frequent timezones/languages

There are plenty of things that could be added to the script, feel free to contribute! üëç
