### Bring web docs to the Kindle


Kindlefodder is a Ruby framework and a collection of recipes for
translating website-bound books and documentation into Kindle ebooks that
are easy to navigate and a pleasure to peruse. Web browsers are good for
scanning information, but Kindles are a lot better when you want to
block out distractions and actually learn something.

The ebooks posted here will in most cases be derived from material published
under a Creative Commons license.  I am grateful to the original authors
for writing such good and useful material. They are welcome to take these
ebooks and recipes, modify them, and distribute them under their own name.
