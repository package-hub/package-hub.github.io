### Ansible Integration for Rundeck


In March of 2022 PagerDuty transferred this repo to the [Rundeck Plugins](https://github.com/rundeck-plugins) organization.  _frozenice_ has done a wonderful job bringing this functionality to the Rundeck Community and has asked Rundeck to take over maintenance going forward.  The move will allow us to better manage Issues and approve/merge Pull Requests, etc.  The plugin will continue to be available to the Open Source community.  Over the next few months our team will review all open PRs and merge or provide feedback/review comments as necessary.
