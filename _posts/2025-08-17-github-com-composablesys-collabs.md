### Collabs library monorepo


**Collabs** is a collections library for **collaborative data structures**. These are data structures that look like `Set`, `Map`, `Array`, etc., except they are synchronized between multiple users: when one user changes a collaborative data structure, their changes show up for every other user. You can use them to quickly build collaborative apps along the lines of Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, shared whiteboards, etc.
