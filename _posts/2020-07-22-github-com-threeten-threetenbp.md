### Backport of functionality based on JSR-310 to Java SE 6 and 7. This is NOT an implementation of JSR-310.

JSR-310 provides a new date and time library for Java SE 8.
This project is the backport to Java SE 6 and 7.

See the [main home page](https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/) of the project.

The backport is NOT an implementation of JSR-310, as that would require
jumping through lots of unnecessary hoops.
Instead, this is a simple backport intended to allow users to quickly
use the JSR-310 API on Java SE 6 and 7.
The backport should be referred to using the "ThreeTen" name.

Active development on JSR-310 is at [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/):

This GitHub repository is a fork of that originally used to create JSR-310.
That repository used the same BSD 3-clause license as this repository.

Issues about the backport should be reported here at GitHub.
Pull requests and issues will only be considered so far as matching the behaviour
of the real Java SE 8. Additional requested features will be rejected.
