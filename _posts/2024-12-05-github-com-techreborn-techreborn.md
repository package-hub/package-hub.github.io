## [TechReborn](https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn)

### Tech Reborn is a completely standalone tech mod including tools and machines to gather resources, process materials, and progress through the mod. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/techreborn


TechReborn is a resurrection of GregTech 2.78 for modern Minecraft. It brings most of it's features and behaviors to Minecraft, with lots of tweaks, and a few editions. It also aims to be more compatible with other mods than GregTech, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a standalone mod, compatible with, but not dependent on IC2. We have no plans of ever supporting IC2 classic as of now.

TechReborn is currently in a beta state. Crashes or bugs may happen at any time, so *please* do not use this on a world that is important to you, or at the very least back it up on every update.

We have permission to use Greg's textures (see [here](https://i.imgur.com/YQEMrq5.png?1)).
