### High Performance Software-Defined Block Storage for container, cloud and virtualisation. Fully integrated with Docker, Kubernetes, Openstack, Proxmox etc.


LINSTOR® developed by LINBIT, is a software that manages replicated volumes across a group of machines. With native integration to Kubernetes, LINSTOR makes building, running, and controlling block storage simple. LINSTOR® is open-source software designed to manage block storage devices for large Linux server clusters. It’s used to provide persistent Linux block storage for cloudnative and hypervisor environments. 

Historically LINSTOR started as a resource-file generator for [DRBD®](https://www.linbit.com/drbd/) which conveniently also created LVM/ZFS volumes. By time LINSTOR steadily grew and got new features and drivers in both directions, south-bound like snapshots, LUKS, dm-cache, dm-writecache or nvme, and north-bound drivers for [Kubernetes](https://www.linbit.com/kubernetes/), [Openstack](https://www.linbit.com/openstack/), [Open Nebula](https://www.linbit.com/opennebula/), [Openshift](https://www.linbit.com/openshift-persistent-container-storage-support/), [VMware](https://www.linbit.com/linstor-vsan-software-defined-storage-for-vmware%e2%80%8b/).
