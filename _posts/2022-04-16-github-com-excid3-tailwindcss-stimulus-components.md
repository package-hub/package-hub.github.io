## [tailwindcss-stimulus-components](https://github.com/excid3/tailwindcss-stimulus-components)

### A set of StimulusJS components for TailwindCSS apps similar to Bootstrap JS components.


[Check out the demo](https://excid3.github.io/tailwindcss-stimulus-components/)

This is a set of components (Tabs, Modals, Dropdowns, etc) for TailwindCSS that uses [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org) controllers.

The goal is to make using TailwindCSS as easy as Bootstrap when it comes
to adding Javascript components.
