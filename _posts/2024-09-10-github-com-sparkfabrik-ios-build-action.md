## [ios-build-action](https://github.com/sparkfabrik/ios-build-action)

### Build iOS project (.xcodeproj, .xcworkspace), export .ipa, optional upload to BrowserStack App Live.


This action builds your iOS project (`.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`) and can export the resulting `.ipa` file as GitHub artifact, with optional automatic upload to BrowserStack AppLive, and optional signed production build with App Store upload.

Tested with Ionic, React Native and native ios projects.
