### Pumped up RecyclerView


This is an attempt to make RecyclerView easier to use.

Features built in:
- ProgressBar while adapter hasn't been set
- EmptyView if adapter is empty
- SwipeRefreshLayout (Google's one)
- Infinite scrolling, when you reach the X last item, load more of them.
- Swipe To Dismiss or Swipe To Remove
- Sticky headers (via [Eowise][eowise-sticky-headers], see sample)
