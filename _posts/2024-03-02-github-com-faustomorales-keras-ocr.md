## [keras-ocr](https://github.com/faustomorales/keras-ocr)

### A packaged and flexible version of the CRAFT text detector and Keras CRNN recognition model.


This is a slightly polished and packaged version of the [Keras CRNN implementation](https://github.com/kurapan/CRNN) and the published [CRAFT text detection model](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch). It provides a high level API for training a text detection and OCR pipeline.

Please see [the documentation](https://keras-ocr.readthedocs.io/) for more examples, including for training a custom model.
