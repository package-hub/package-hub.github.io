## [pywebcopy](https://github.com/rajatomar788/pywebcopy)

### Locally saves webpages to your hard disk with images, css, js & links as is.


PyWebCopy will examine the HTML mark-up of a website and attempt to discover all linked resources
such as other pages, images, videos, file downloads - anything and everything.
It will download all of theses resources, and continue to search for more.
In this manner, WebCopy can "crawl" an entire website and download everything it sees
in an effort to create a reasonable facsimile of the source website.
