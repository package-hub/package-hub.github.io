## [idacode](https://github.com/ioncodes/idacode)

### An integration for IDA and VS Code which connects both to easily execute and debug IDAPython scripts.

IDACode makes it easy to execute and debug Python scripts in your IDA environment without leaving Visual Studio Code. The VS Code extension can be found on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Layle.idacode).  
IDACode is still in a very early state and bugs are to be expected. Please open a new issue if you encounter any issues.
