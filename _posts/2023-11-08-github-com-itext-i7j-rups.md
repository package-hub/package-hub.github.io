### RUPS is an acronym for Reading and Updating PDF Syntax. RUPS is a tool built on top of iTextÂ® that allows you to look inside a PDF document and browse the different PDF objects and content streams. 


iText Rups is built into a Jar file which is then run by Java. To build iText Rups with Maven, run the following command:
```
mvn clean package
```

The resultant Jar file with dependencies will be located in the `target` directory.

To run RUPS, simply type

```
java -jar itext-rups-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
