### Blender addon for working more precisely with vertex colours.


> __Warning:__ This addon does not work well from **Blender 3.2 to 3.6** due to internal changes in vertex attributes in Blender. However, there is currently an [0.9.0 alpha release](https://github.com/andyp123/blender_vertex_color_master/releases/tag/v0.9.0alpha) available that should work with **Blender 4.0+**. This alpha release has some issues (notably the redo panel) that may be fixed in the future, but I can't make any guarantees due to other commitments.

> Users with **Blender 3.1** and prior should be fine using the much older [0.8.4 release](https://github.com/andyp123/blender_vertex_color_master/releases/tag/v0.84).

An add-on for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) that adds numerous features to assist working with vertex colors.
