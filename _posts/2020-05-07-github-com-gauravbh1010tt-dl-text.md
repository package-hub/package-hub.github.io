## [DL-text](https://github.com/GauravBh1010tt/DL-text)

### Text pre-processing library for deep learning (Keras, tensorflow).

This repository consists of modules for pre-processing the textual data. Examples are also given for training deep models (DNN, CNN, RNN, LSTM). There are many additional functionilities which are as follows:
- Preparing data for problems like sentiment analysis, sentence contextual similarity, question answering, machine translation, etc.
- Compute lexical and semantic hand-crafted features like words overlap, n-gram overlap, td-idf, count features, etc.  Most of these features are used in the following papers:
  - [External features for community question answering](http://maroo.cs.umass.edu/getpdf.php?id=1281). 
  - [Voltron: A Hybrid System For Answer Validation Based On Lexical And Distance Features](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/cdrom/pdf/SemEval043.pdf). 
- Implementation of deep models as described in the following papers (for reproducible code refer to [DeepLearn-repo](https://github.com/GauravBh1010tt/DeepLearn)):
  - [WIKIQA: A Challenge Dataset for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1237).
  - [Learning to Rank Short Text Pairs with Convolutional Deep Neural Networks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.6492&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
  - [Neural-based Approaches for Ranking in Community Question Answering](http://aclweb.org/anthology/S/S16/S16-1128.pdf).
- Implementation of evaluation metrics such as MAP, MRR, AP@k, BM25 etc.
