### alf.io - The open source ticket reservation system for conferences, trade shows, workshops, meetups


As the work for Alf.io [v2](https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/milestones) has started, this branch may contain **unstable** and **untested** code.
If you want to build and deploy alf.io by yourself, we strongly suggest you to use the [2.0-M4-maintenance](https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/tree/2.0-M4-maintenance) branch, as it contains production-ready code.
