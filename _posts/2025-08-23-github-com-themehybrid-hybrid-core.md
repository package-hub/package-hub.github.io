### Official repository for the Hybrid Core WordPress development framework.


Hybrid Core is a framework for developing WordPress plugins and themes.

The core package is the application layer that primarily consists of a service container.  It can be used alone or alongside any of the available [Hybrid packages](https://github.com/themehybrid/).

The framework simplifies many of the complexities of WordPress development and helps you write more modern PHP code.  Its goal is to provide elegant functions, classes, and interfaces for writing code without the need to rebuild everything from scratch with each project.
