### Distributed object system for Ruby


dRuby is a distributed object system for Ruby.  It allows an object in one
Ruby process to invoke methods on an object in another Ruby process on the
same or a different machine.

The Ruby standard library contains the core classes of the dRuby package.
However, the full package also includes access control lists and the
Rinda tuple-space distributed task management system, as well as a
large number of samples.  The full dRuby package can be downloaded from
the dRuby home page (see *References*).

For an introduction and examples of usage see the documentation to the
DRb module.
