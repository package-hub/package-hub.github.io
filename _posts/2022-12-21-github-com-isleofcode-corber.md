### CLI for building hybrid apps with Ember/Vue/Glimmer/Cordova


Corber is a CLI that improves the hybrid app build experience for Vue, Ember, Glimmer, and React apps using Cordova.

Corber handles framework and app builds and validations with a single command: `corber build` - without affecting existing web flows. The CLI also includes on-device livereload for development and utility functions for icons, plugins, and more. And when needed, it can proxy to the Cordova CLI.

It is a continuation of the ember-cordova project. ember-cordova users can find details [here](http://blog.isleofcode.com/announcing-corber-ember-cordova-vue), and continue to access the existing [ember addon](https://github.com/isleofcode/ember-cordova) and [documentation](http://ember-cordova.com). For migration instructions, see [Migrating from Ember Cordova](http://corber.io/pages/ember-cordova-migration).
