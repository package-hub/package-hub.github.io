## [KomodoEdit](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit)

### Komodo Edit is a fast and free multi-language code editor. Written in JS, Python, C++ and based on the Mozilla platform.


This readme explains how to get started building, using and developing with
the Komodo Edit source base.

Whilst the main Komodo Edit source is hosted under this repository you may also
want to check out the individual component/addon repositories under
https://github.com/Komodo in case you only want to contribute to a specific
component. This'll save you some time and hassle as you would not have to build
the entire project.
