### Google's libphonenumber pre-compiled with the closure compiler


This library is a pre-compiled version of Google's `libphonenumber`, with a slightly simpler interface. It has a minimal footprint - is by far the smallest libphonenumber-based library available on npmjs, and has no dependencies.

TypeScript typings are provided within the package.

Uses libphonenumber v8.13.40
