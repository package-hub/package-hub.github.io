### OpenCart Community Edition is an unofficial fork dedicated to backporting all the latest OpenCart bug fixes.  This allows users to maintain a stable and secure store without having to wait extended periods between major releases or upgrade to an OpenCart version which may be incompatible with their extensions or themes.

OpenCart Community Edition has published its first release candidate.  Release candidates are the final step before a full release.  They're tested stable but may have unknown issues that are found in wider testing.

This release candidate is best suited for developers, advanced users, or anyone wanting to test Community Edition.  An official release will follow a period of user testing and feedback.

The repo is set to initially include OpenCart 1.5.5.x and 1.5.4.x with possible expansion to earlier 1.5.x versions at a later date.  To reduce file size and help code alignment in GitHub, inconsistencies in whitespace (a space mixed in with the tabs and vice versa) will be fixed on the initial push.  Please make sure you're using this whitespace standardized version when submitting a pull request and not an OpenCart default version.
