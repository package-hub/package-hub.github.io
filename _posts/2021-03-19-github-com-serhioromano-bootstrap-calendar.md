## [bootstrap-calendar](https://github.com/Serhioromano/bootstrap-calendar)

### Full view calendar with year, month, week and day views based on templates with Twitter Bootstrap.


Why did I start this project? Well, I believe there are no good full view calendar's out there with native Bootstrap support. In fact I could not find even one. A different UI and UX concept approach is also used.
