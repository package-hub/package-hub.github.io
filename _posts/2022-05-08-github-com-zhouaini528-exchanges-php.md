## [exchanges-php](https://github.com/zhouaini528/exchanges-php)

### This is a virtual currency SDK that brings together multiple exchanges

This SDK brings together the APIs of the many exchanges currently trading the most, allowing developers to focus only on the business layer. It is based on [Bitmex](https://github.com/zhouaini528/bitmex-php) [Okex](https://github.com/zhouaini528/okex-php) [Huobi](https://github.com/zhouaini528/huobi-php) [Binance](https://github.com/zhouaini528/binance-php) and so on, and these underlying APIs are encapsulated again. Its advantages support multiple platforms at the same time, support unified parameter input and output, also support native parameter input, and simple quantitative trading to fully meet your needs. Even if you have special requirements, you can use the method [getPlatform()](https://github.com/zhouaini528/exchanges-php#support-for-original-parameters) to return the instance and call the underlying API.
