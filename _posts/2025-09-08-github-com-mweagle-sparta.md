## [Sparta](https://github.com/mweagle/Sparta)

### go microservices, powered by AWS Lambda


Times have changed since I started this work. I no longer have the resources to adequately maintain this project. Additionally, there now also exist several other options, including [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), around which lively communities have formed. With v3, all CloudFormation API changes have been migrated to [go-formation](https://github.com/awslabs/goformation) and all AWS API SDK calls moved to [AWS v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2). This likely marks the end of my active development on Sparta.

If this project has been helpful to you and you're interested in becoming a shepherd, please open an issue. Thanks all for your feedback, support, and recommendations over the years.

Keep on serverlessing!
