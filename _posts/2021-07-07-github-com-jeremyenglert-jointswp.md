## [JointsWP](https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP)

### A blank WordPress theme built with Foundation 6, giving you all the power and flexibility you need to build complex, mobile friendly websites without having to start from scratch.

JointsWP requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v6.9.x or newer. This doesn't mean you need to understand Node (or even Gulp) - it's just the steps we need to take to make sure all of our development tools are installed.
