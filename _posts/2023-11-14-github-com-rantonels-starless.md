Starless is a CPU black hole raytracer in numpy suitable for both informative diagrams and decent wallpaper material.

It is still in development and will be presented on my site along with [my real time black hole visualizer](http://spiro.fisica.unipd.it/~antonell/schwarzschild). Starless, instead, is not real time but offers greater functionality, performing actual raytracing (while the mentioned WebGL applet uses a precomputed lookup texture for deflection).
