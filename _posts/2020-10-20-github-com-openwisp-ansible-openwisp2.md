### Ansible role that installs and upgrades openwisp 2


**Since August 2018 there's a new fast and easy way to install OpenWISP 2 for testing
purposes** leveraging [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), a popular open source
tool for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments.

To use this new way, clone the repository [vagrant-openwisp2](https://github.com/openwisp/vagrant-openwisp2),
it contains the instructions (in the `README.md`) and the vagrant configuration
to perform the automatic installation.

Alternatively, you can read on to learn how to install *VirtualBox* and run
*ansible-openwisp2* manually, this is useful if you need to test advanced
customisations of *OpenWISP*.
