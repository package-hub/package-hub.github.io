## [js-tracker](https://github.com/pilagod/js-tracker)

### A chrome extension tracks front-end JavaScript that uses DOM / jQuery APIs to manipulate html dom elements (e.g., change style, attach event listener) at runtime.


* **Live Tracking**, what changes you see on page is what code you get.
* **Code by Elements**, only listing the code that affects selected element.
* **Brief Overview**, getting rough code information at a glance.
* **Easy Filtering**, grouping manipulations into 5 types.
* **Link to Source**, one click to see all details.
* **Performance Improvement**, better performance than previous version by taking advantage of browser JavaScript engine
