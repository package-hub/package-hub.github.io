Download the website to the local directory (including all css, images, js, etc.)

**Note:** by default dynamic websites (where content is loaded by js) may be saved not correctly because `website-scraper` doesn't execute js, it only parses http responses for html and css files. If you need to download a dynamic website take a look at [website-scraper-puppeteer](https://github.com/website-scraper/website-scraper-puppeteer).
