### convert mmdetection model to tensorrt, support fp16, int8, batch input, dynamic shape etc.


This project aims to convert the mmdetection model to TensorRT model end2end.
Focus on object detection for now.
Mask support is **experiment**.

support:

- fp16
- int8(experiment)
- batched input
- dynamic input shape
- combination of different modules
- deepstream support

Any advices, bug reports and stars are welcome.
