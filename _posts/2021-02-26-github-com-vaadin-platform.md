## [platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform)

### Vaadin platform 10+ is Java web development platform based on Vaadin web components.  If you don't know to which repository your bug report should be filed, use this and we'll move it to the right one.


[Vaadin platform](https://vaadin.com/) consists of a set of web components, a Java web framework called Vaadin Flow, configurable themes, tools and a set of opinionated app starters. Platform releases gather all products in to a single package every quarter. The product versions included in a platform release are not necessarily the latest released versions, but are hand picked so that they work well together.
