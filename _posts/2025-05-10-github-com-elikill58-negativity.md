### Github of Negativity, a Minecraft AntiCheat. Premium at 8â‚¬:


Negativity is a Minecraft **AntiCheat** plugin designed for **Spigot (versions 1.8.8 to 1.20)** and is also compatible with **forks of Spigot**. It can be used with both **Bungeecord** and **Velocity**.

Please note that Negativity is not compatible with Spigot 1.7.10 and Sponge versions after 1.13.

Even if you plan to use it on your proxy server, you still need to install the plugin on your Spigot or Sponge server.

**The free version has no longer support. Only the premium one has**.
