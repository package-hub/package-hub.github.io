### A JavaScript framework for interactive (mathematical) content.


**CindyJS is a framework to create interactive
(mathematical) content for the web.**

It aims to be compatible with [Cinderella](http://cinderella.de/),
providing an interpreter for the scripting language CindyScript
as well as a set of geometric operations which can be used to describe
constructions.
Together, these components make it very easy to visualize various
concepts, from geometry in particular and mathematics in general,
but also from various other fields.
