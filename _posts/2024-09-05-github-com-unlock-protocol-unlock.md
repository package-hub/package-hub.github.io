### É„nlock is a protocol for memberships built on a blockchain.


[You can try Unlock using the Ethereum blockchain on our homepage.](https://unlock-protocol.com/)

We are building this in the open, which means you can also run the code locally (see instructions below).
You can try out the staging version - which runs the latest, in-progress code, but against the Goerli test network.
