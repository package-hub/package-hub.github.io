## [openvk](https://github.com/OpenVK/openvk)

### Not-yet-federated open source social network inspired by VK.


_[Русский](README_RU.md)_

**OpenVK** is an attempt to create a simple CMS that ~~cosplays~~ imitates old VKontakte. Code provided here is not stable yet.

VKontakte belongs to Pavel Durov and VK Group.

To be honest, we don't know whether if it even works. However, this version is maintained and we will be happy to accept your bugreports [in our bug tracker](https://github.com/openvk/openvk/projects/1). You should also be able to submit them using [ticketing system](https://ovk.to/support?act=new) (you will need an OpenVK account for this).
