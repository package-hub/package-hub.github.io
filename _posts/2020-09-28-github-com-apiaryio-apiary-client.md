### Apiary CLI client


The Apiary CLI Client gem is a command line tool for developing and previewing
[API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org) documents locally. It can also be
used for pushing updated documents to and fetching existing documents from
[Apiary](http://apiary.io).


Please see the `apiary help` command and the [full documentation](http://client.apiary.io) for an in-depth look in how to use this tool.

For instructions on making your  own changes, see [Hacking Apiary CLI Client](#hacking-apiary-cli-client), below.
