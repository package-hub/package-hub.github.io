### Vector (and Scalar) Quantization, in Pytorch


A vector quantization library originally transcribed from Deepmind's tensorflow implementation, made conveniently into a package. It uses exponential moving averages to update the dictionary.

VQ has been successfully used by Deepmind and OpenAI for high quality generation of images (VQ-VAE-2) and music (Jukebox).
