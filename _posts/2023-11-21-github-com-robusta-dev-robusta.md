### Kubernetes observability and automation, with an awesome Prometheus integration

Robusta is both an automations engine for Kubernetes, and a [multi-cluster observability platform](https://home.robusta.dev/).

Robusta is commonly used alongside Prometheus, but other tools are supported too.

By listening to all the events in your cluster, Robusta can tell you *why* alerts fired, what happened at the same time, and what you can do about it.

Robusta can either improve your existing alerts, or be used to define new alerts triggered by APIServer changes.
