### Bazel remote caching and execution service


This repository hosts the [Bazel](https://bazel.build) remote caching and execution system.

Background information on the status of caching and remote execution in bazel can be
found in the [bazel documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html).

File issues here for bugs or feature requests, and ask questions via build team [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/buildteamworld/shared_invite/zt-4zy8f5j5-KwiJuBoAAUorB_mdQHwF7Q) in the #buildfarm channel.
