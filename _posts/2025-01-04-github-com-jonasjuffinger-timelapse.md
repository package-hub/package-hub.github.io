### A time lapse app for Sony Alpha camera using the OpenMemories framework

A time lapse app for Sony Alpha cameras using the [OpenMemories: Framework](https://github.com/ma1co/OpenMemories-Framework).

I have only a a6300 to test it, if you have another camera I would be happy to receive bug reports.
