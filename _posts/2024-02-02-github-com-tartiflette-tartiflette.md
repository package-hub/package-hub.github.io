### GraphQL Engine built with Python 3.6+ / asyncio


[Read this blogpost about our motivations](https://medium.com/dailymotion/tartiflette-graphql-api-engine-python-open-source-a200c5bbc477)
TL; DR
We reached the limits of Graphene, we wanted to build something which met certain requirements:
* **Offers a better developer experience** that respects the Python mindset
* **Uses SDL** _(Schema Definition Language)_
* Uses **asyncio** as the sole execution engine
* Be 100% open source
