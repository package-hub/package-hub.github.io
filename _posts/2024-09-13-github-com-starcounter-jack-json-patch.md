## [JSON-Patch](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch)

### Lean and mean Javascript implementation of the JSON-Patch standard (RFC 6902). Update JSON documents using delta patches.


JSON-Patch [(RFC6902)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) is a standard format that
allows you to update a JSON document by sending the changes rather than the whole document.
JSON Patch plays well with the HTTP PATCH verb (method) and REST style programming.

Mark Nottingham has a [nice blog]( http://www.mnot.net/blog/2012/09/05/patch) about it.
