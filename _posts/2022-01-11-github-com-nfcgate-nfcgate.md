### An NFC research toolkit application for Android

This application was developed for security research purposes by students of the [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/), [Secure Mobile Networking Lab](https://www.seemoo.tu-darmstadt.de/). Please do not use this application for malicious purposes.

This application was presented at WiSec 2015.
