### An gnome-shell extension to put the icons back to the tray.


> As stated in issue [#91](https://github.com/phocean/TopIcons-plus/issues/91), I have stopped maintaining this project actively.

The Gnome project chose to drop status icons and any kind of legacy tray, making the project useless on the long term and difficult to maintain due to bugs or lack of features that are out of its scope.

In particular, no wayland support can be achieved.

Open such issues not here but to the Gnome project.

Meanwhile, I encourage you to migrate to libappindicator and its [extension](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator), which is supported by most applications nowadays.

> The code here should still work. I will happily merge good pull requests and package releases when necessary.
