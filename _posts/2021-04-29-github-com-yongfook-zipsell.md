### A free open source platform for selling digital downloads such as ebooks


Zipsell helps you set up an online store for selling digital products such as ebooks, music, videos, source code etc. 

Zipsell handles payment processing via stripe and sends customers secure expiring Amazon S3 links to the files they have purchased. Since it is self-hosted, you receive payments directly and avoid paying commissions to 3rd party marketplaces.

Zipsell is built with Ruby on Rails.
