## [github-search](https://github.com/gwen001/github-search)

### A collection of tools to perform searches on GitHub.


```
git clone https://github.com/gwen001/github-search
cd github-search
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Most of the time GitHub requires a token to perform searches.  

You can create a `.tokens` file in the cloned repo directory with 1 token per line  
OR  
You can configure an environment variable (recommended) like this: `GIHTHUB_TOKEN=token1,token2,...`
