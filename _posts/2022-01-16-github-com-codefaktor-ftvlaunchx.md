## [FTVLaunchX](https://github.com/codefaktor/FTVLaunchX)

### Simple helper application to allow custom launchers on Amazon Fire TV devices.


-   Reliably intercepts any & all presses of the home button.

-   Starts the selected launcher on boot (note that this can take
    up to a minute on older devices).

-   Starts the selected launcher when waking up from sleep.

-   Allows use of the original long-press-on-home functionality
    by holding down the menu key in parallel.

-   Works with any launcher or other app like e.g.
    -   [Android TV Launcher](https://leanback-launcher.en.aptoide.com/)
    -   [Leanback Launcher](https://github.com/tsynik/LeanbackLauncher)
    -   [TV Launcher 3](https://tvlauncher.en.aptoide.com/)
    -   [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/)
