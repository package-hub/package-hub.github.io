### ðŸŒ¶ 350b / 650b state container with component actions for Preact & React


> A tiny 350b centralized state container with component bindings for [Preact] & [React].

- **Small** footprint complements Preact nicely _(unistore + unistore/preact is ~650b)_
- **Familiar** names and ideas from Redux-like libraries
- **Useful** data selectors to extract properties from state
- **Portable** actions can be moved into a common place and imported
- **Functional** actions are just reducers
- **NEW**: seamlessly run Unistore in a worker via [Stockroom](https://github.com/developit/stockroom)
