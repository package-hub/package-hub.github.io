### Yii2 user authentication module


This release contains a few small updates and bug fixes. Most notably, I've changed
`LoginForm.username` to `LoginForm.email` and added a timezone field to `app\models\Profile`
(thanks [mnglkhn](https://github.com/amnah/yii2-user/pull/127))

If there are any issues, [let me know](https://github.com/amnah/yii2-user/issues) and I'll get
to it asap.
