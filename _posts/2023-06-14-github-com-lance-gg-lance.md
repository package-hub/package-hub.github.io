### Multiplayer game server based on Node.JS


It provides an extendible Node.JS based server, on which game logic runs, as well as a client-side library
which synchronizes the client's game state with the server game state.  In order
to provide a smooth visual experience for each connected client, Lance implements
efficient networking methods, position interpolation and extrapolation, user input
coordination, shadow objects, physics and pseudo-physical movement, automatic
handling of network spikes.

Lance aims to optimize the player's visual experience, while providing
a simple development model which is highly configurable and easy to analyze
and debug.
