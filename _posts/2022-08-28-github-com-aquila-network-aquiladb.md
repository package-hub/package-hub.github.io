* If you are working on a data science project and need to store a hell of a lot of data and retrieve similar data based on some feature vector, this will be a useful tool to you, with extra benefits a real world web application needs.
* Are you dealing with a lot of images and related metadata? Want to find similar ones? You are at the right place.
* If you are looking for a document database, this is not the right place for you.
