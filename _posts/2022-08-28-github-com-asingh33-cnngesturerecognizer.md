### Gesture recognition via CNN. Implemented in Keras + Tensorflow/Theano + OpenCV

Gesture recognition via CNN neural network implemented in Keras + Theano + OpenCV


Key Requirements:
Python 3.6.1
OpenCV 3.4.1
Keras 2.0.2
Tensorflow 1.2.1
Theano 0.9.0   (obsolete and not supported any further)

Suggestion: Better to download Anaconda as it will take care of most of the other packages and easier to setup a virtual workspace to work with multiple versions of key packages like python, opencv etc.
