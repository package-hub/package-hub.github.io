### Social logging script for Day One


*If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.0.12, please remove the RSSLogger section from `slogger_config` and regenerate it by running slogger again. A new section will be added in addition to RSSLogger called Bloglogger. RSSLogger now logs all entries for the timespan as a single digest entry, whereas Bloglogger loads each item found as an individual "post."*
