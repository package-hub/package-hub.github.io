### ðŸ”® Proxies nodejs require in order to allow overriding dependencies during testing.


Proxies nodejs's require in order to make overriding dependencies during testing easy while staying **totally unobtrusive**.

If you want to stub dependencies for your client side modules, try
[proxyquireify](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquireify), a proxyquire for [browserify
v2](https://github.com/substack/browserify) or [proxyquire-universal](https://github.com/bendrucker/proxyquire-universal) 
to test in both Node and the browser.
