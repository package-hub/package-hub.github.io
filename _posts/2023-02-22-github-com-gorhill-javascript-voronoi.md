### A Javascript implementation of Fortune's algorithm to compute Voronoi cells


A Javascript implementation of Steven J. Fortune's algorithm to
efficiently compute Voronoi diagrams. The Voronoi object's purpose is
to solely compute a Voronoi diagram, it is completely standalone, with
no dependency on external code: it contains no rendering code: that is
left to the user of the library.
