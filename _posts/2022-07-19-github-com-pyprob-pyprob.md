## [pyprob](https://github.com/pyprob/pyprob)

### A probabilistic programming system for simulators and high-performance computing (HPC), based on PyTorch


We support front ends in multiple languages through the
[PPX](https://github.com/pyprob/ppx) interface that allows execution of models
and inference engines in separate programming languages, processes, and machines
connected over a network.
