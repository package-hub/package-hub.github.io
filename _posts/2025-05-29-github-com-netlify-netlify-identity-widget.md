### A zero config, framework free Netlify Identity widget


Netlify's Identity service is a plug-and-play microservice for handling site
functionalities like signups, logins, password recovery, user metadata, and
roles. You can use it from single page apps instead of rolling your own, and
integrate with any service that understands JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Learn more about this service from this
[blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/09/07/introducing-built-in-identity-service-to-streamline-user-management/).
