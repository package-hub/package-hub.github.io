### SEO Tools for Laravel


The first step is using composer to install the package and automatically update your `composer.json` file, you can do this by running:

```shell
composer require artesaos/seotools
```

> **Note**: If you are using Laravel 5.5, the steps 2 and 3, for providers and aliases, are unnecessaries. SEOTools supports Laravel new [Package Discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages#package-discovery).
