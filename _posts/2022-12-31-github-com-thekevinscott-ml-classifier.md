### A tool for quickly training image classifiers in the browser


ML Classifier is a machine learning engine for quickly training image classification models in your browser. Models can be saved with a single command, and the resulting models reused to make image classification predictions.

This package is intended as a companion for [`ml-classifier-ui`](https://github.com/thekevinscott/ml-classifier-ui), which provides a web frontend in React for uploading data and seeing results.
