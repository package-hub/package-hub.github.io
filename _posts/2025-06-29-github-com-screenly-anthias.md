## [Anthias](https://github.com/Screenly/Anthias)

### The world's most popular open source digital signage project.


Anthias is a digital signage platform for Raspberry Pi devices and PCs. Formerly known as Screenly OSE, it was rebranded to clear up the confusion between Screenly (the paid version) and Anthias. More details can be found in [this blog post](https://www.screenly.io/blog/2022/12/06/screenly-ose-now-called-anthias/).
