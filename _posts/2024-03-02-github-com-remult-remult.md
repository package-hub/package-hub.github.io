### Full-stack CRUD, simplified, with SSOT TypeScript entities


**Remult** is a full-stack CRUD framework that uses your **TypeScript entities
as a single source of truth for your API, frontend type-safe API client and
backend ORM**.

- :zap: Zero-boilerplate CRUD API routes with paging, sorting, and filtering for Express / Fastify / Next.js / NestJS / Koa / others...
- :ok_hand: Fullstack type-safety for API queries, mutations and RPC, without code generation
- :sparkles: Input validation, defined once, runs both on the backend and on the frontend for best UX
- :lock: Fine-grained code-based API authorization
- :relieved: Incrementally adoptable
- :rocket: Production ready
- :mega: **NEW - Zero-boilerplate realtime live-queries**
