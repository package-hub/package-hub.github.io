### Java SDK for connecting to AWS IoT from a device. 


A new AWS IoT Device SDK is [now available](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iot-device-sdk-java-v2). It is a complete rework, built to improve reliability, performance, and security. We invite your feedback!

This SDK will no longer receive feature updates, but will receive security updates.
