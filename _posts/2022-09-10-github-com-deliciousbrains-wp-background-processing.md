### WordPress background processing class


WP Background Processing can be used to fire off non-blocking asynchronous requests or as a background processing tool, allowing you to queue tasks. Check out the [example plugin](https://github.com/A5hleyRich/wp-background-processing-example) or read the [accompanying article](https://deliciousbrains.com/background-processing-wordpress/).

Inspired by [TechCrunch WP Asynchronous Tasks](https://github.com/techcrunch/wp-async-task).

__Requires PHP 5.2+__
