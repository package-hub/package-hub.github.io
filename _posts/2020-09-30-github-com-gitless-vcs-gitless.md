## [gitless](https://github.com/gitless-vcs/gitless)

### A simple version control system built on top of Git


Binary releases for macOS and Linux are available from the
[Gitless website](http://gitless.com "Gitless's website").

If you've downloaded a binary release of Gitless everything is contained in the
gl binary, so to install simply do:

    $ cp path-to-downloaded-gl-binary /usr/local/bin/gl

You can put the binary in other locations as well, just be sure to update your
`PATH`.

If for some reason this doesn't work (maybe you are running an old version of
your OS?), try one of the other options (installing from source or via
the Python Package Index).
