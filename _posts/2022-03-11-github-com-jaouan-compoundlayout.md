## [CompoundLayout](https://github.com/Jaouan/CompoundLayout)

### It's an Android library that allows you to use Layout as RadioButton or CheckBox.

*CompoundLayout* checked state can be changed programmatically using method **myCompoundLayout.setChecked()**.
Checked state can be retrieved using **myCompoundLayout.isChecked()**, and can be listened using **myCompoundLayout.setOnCheckedChangeListener()**.
