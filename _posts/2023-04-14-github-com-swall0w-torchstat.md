### Model analyzer in PyTorch

This is a lightweight neural network analyzer based on PyTorch.
It is designed to make building your networks quick and easy, with the ability to debug them.
**Note**: This repository is currently under development. Therefore, some APIs might be changed.

This tools can show

* Total number of network parameters
* Theoretical amount of floating point arithmetics (FLOPs)
* Theoretical amount of multiply-adds (MAdd)
* Memory usage
