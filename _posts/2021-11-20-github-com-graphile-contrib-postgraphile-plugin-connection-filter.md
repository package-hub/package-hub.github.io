### Filtering on PostGraphile connections


Adds a powerful suite of filtering capabilities to a PostGraphile schema.

> **Warning:** Use of this plugin with the default options may make it **astoundingly trivial** for a malicious actor (or a well-intentioned application that generates complex GraphQL queries) to overwhelm your database with expensive queries. See the [Performance and Security](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter#performance-and-security) section below for details.
