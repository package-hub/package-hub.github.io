## [sendportal](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal)

### Open-source self-hosted email marketing. Manage your own newsletters at a fraction of the cost. 


The core functionality of SendPortal is contained within the [SendPortal Core](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal-core) package. If you would like to add SendPortal to an existing application that already handles user authentication, you only require [SendPortal Core](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal-core).
