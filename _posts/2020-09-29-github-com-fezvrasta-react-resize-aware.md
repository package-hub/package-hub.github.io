### ⇲👁 A simple React Hook which allows to listen the resize event of any target element when it changes sizes


It does one thing, it does it well: listens to resize events on any HTML element.

`react-resize-aware` is a zero dependency, **~600 bytes** [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) you can use to detect resize events without relying on intervals, loops, DOM manipulation detection or CSS redraws.

**It takes advantage of the `resize` event on the `HTMLObjectElement`, works on any browser I know of, and it's super lightweight.**

In addition, it doesn't directly alters the DOM, everything is handled by React.
