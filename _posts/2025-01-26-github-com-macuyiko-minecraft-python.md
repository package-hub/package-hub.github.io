### A Jython driven plugin and interpreter system for Minecraft (on top of Spigot)


`minecraft-python` is a Spigot plugin providing the ability to control Minecraft using Python. Contrary to other approaches, this project aims to expose the whole Bukkit API to Python, instead of only providing a few commands by hardcoding or wrapping these in a Spigot plugin.

More background information on how this project came to be can be found on [this blog post](http://blog.macuyiko.com/post/2015/rebuilding-our-jython-console-plugin-for-minecraft.html) (a bit outdated at the moment).

You can watch a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JfwS5hNlw) video showing off some of the possibilities (also a bit outdated by now but gets the idea across).
