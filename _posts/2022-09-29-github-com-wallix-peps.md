### Innovative Open source Email + File sharing


PEPS is an open source email, file sharing and collaboration server that intends to fullfil the need for high-quality on-premises software that could rival with top-notch SaaS products such as Gmail or Dropbox, and innovate with new features.

PEPS is built to be extensible thanks to complete APIs and we aim at creating an ecosystem of compatible apps and services.
