Use your IAM user's public SSH key to get access via SSH to an **EC2 instance** running
* Amazon Linux 2017.09
* Amazon Linux 2 2017.12
* Ubuntu 16.04
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3
* RHEL 7.4
* CentOS 7

`aws-ec2-ssh` depends on the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and `git` if you use the `install.sh` script.
