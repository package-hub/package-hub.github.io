### Git extension: Makes git-diff work for VBA in Excel workbooks (xls* file types)


(Note: Git XL was previously called "git-xltrail")

Git XL is an open-source Git command line extension for managing Excel workbook files in Git.

The extension makes `git diff` work for Excel VBA (xls, xlt, xla, xlam, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, xltx, xltm). Git XL does not require Excel as it works directly on the workbook file.

With Git XL installed, Git can diff Excel VBA just like any other source code file.

It is written in Python, with pre-compiled binaries available for Windows.

Installation instructions and docs are available at [https://www.xltrail.com/git-xl](https://www.xltrail.com/git-xl).
