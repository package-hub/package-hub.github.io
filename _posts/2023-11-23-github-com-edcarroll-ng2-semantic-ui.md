### Semantic UI Angular Integrations (no jQuery)


Angular and jQuery don't go together - this is the fundamental principal of this library. It provides Angular component versions of the Semantic UI modules, so that you don't need to add jQuery to your app.

Note that only Semantic UI elements that use jQuery are recreated here - those written purely in CSS aren't included as they can be used in Angular apps already.
