## [Foundation](https://github.com/kangarko/Foundation)

### Foundationâ„¢ helps you create highly customized Minecraft plugins (based on Spigot/Paper API) that support multiple MC versions.


1. Import Foundation using Maven/Gradle (see the Importing section).
2. Change "**extends JavaPlugin**" to "**extends SimplePlugin**" (we need that to register things and listeners on our end automatically)
3. Change **onEnable()** to **onPluginStart()** and **onDisable()** to **onPluginStop()** (we occupy these methods to perform logic)
4. If you use a **static getInstance()** method in your main plugin's class, change it to return **(T) SimplePlugin.getInstance()** where T is your plugin instead. Delete the instance of your plugin from your class if you use it (if you have myPlugin = this anywhere, remove it).

For a sample plugin, see [PluginTemplate](https://github.com/kangarko/plugintemplate).

A complete tutorial on how to use this library is a part of our Project Orion training available [here](https://mineacademy.org/project-orion)
