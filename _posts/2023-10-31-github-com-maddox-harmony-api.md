### ðŸ—¼ A simple server allowing you to query/control multiple local Harmony Home Hubs over HTTP or MQTT


Harmony API is a simple server allowing you to query/control multiple local [Harmony
Home Hubs](http://myharmony.com/products/detail/home-hub/) and their devices
over HTTP or MQTT.

With HTTP, you can simply turn on and off activities, check hub status, and send
commands to individual devices with simple HTTP requests from almost any other
project.

With MQTT, you can easily monitor the state of your devices as well as set
the current activity of your hub or send specific commands per device. This
makes it super easy to integrate into your existing home automation setup.
