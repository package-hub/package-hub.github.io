## [Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages)

### Home Assistant integration providing day of package counts and USPS informed delivery images.


The [Mail and Packages integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages) creates sensors for [supported shippers](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Supported-Shipper-Requirements) to show a snapshot of mail and **packages that are scheduled to be delivered the current day**. For the packages that are scheduled for delivery the current day a count of in transit and delivered packages will be provided. It also generates the number of USPS mail pieces and provides a rotating GIF of the USPS provided images of the mail, if available, for the current day.
