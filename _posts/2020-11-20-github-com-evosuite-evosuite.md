### EvoSuite - automated generation of JUnit test suites for Java classes


EvoSuite automatically generates JUnit test suites for Java classes, targeting code coverage criteria such as branch coverage. It uses an evolutionary approach based on a genetic algorithm to derive test suites. To improve readability, the generated unit tests are minimized, and regression assertions that capture the current behavior of the tested classes are added to the tests.
