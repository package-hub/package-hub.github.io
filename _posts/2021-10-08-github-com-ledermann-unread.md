## [unread](https://github.com/ledermann/unread)

### Handle unread records and mark them as read with Ruby on Rails


* Manages unread records for anything you want readers (e.g. users) to read (like messages, documents, comments etc.)
* Supports _mark as read_ to mark a **single** record as read
* Supports _mark all as read_ to mark **all** records as read in a single step
* Gives you a scope to get the unread records for a given reader
* Needs only one additional database table
* Most important: Great performance
