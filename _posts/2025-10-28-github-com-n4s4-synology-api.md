### A Python wrapper around Synology API


If you find yourself here, most probably you are trying to develop something for your NAS, this wrapper might come to your help to build your script.

I would like to specify that I do this for hobby as is my passion and in my little free time.

Said this, there is no warranties chained and this library is provided "As Is", you will find many things can be simplified, and I slowly will but feel free to [Contribute](https://n4s4.github.io/synology-api/docs/contribute).
