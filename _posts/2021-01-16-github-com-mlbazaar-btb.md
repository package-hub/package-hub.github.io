### A simple, extensible library for developing AutoML systems


BTB ("Bayesian Tuning and Bandits") is a simple, extensible backend for developing auto-tuning
systems such as AutoML systems. It provides an easy-to-use interface for *tuning* models and
*selecting* between models.

It is currently being used in several AutoML systems:

- [ATM](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ATM), a distributed, multi-tenant AutoML system for
classifier tuning
- [MIT's system](https://github.com/HDI-Project/mit-d3m-ta2/) for the DARPA
[Data-driven discovery of models](https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) (D3M) program
- [AutoBazaar](https://github.com/MLBazaar/AutoBazaar), a flexible, general-purpose
AutoML system
