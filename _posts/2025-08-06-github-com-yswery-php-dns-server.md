### An Authoritative DNS Server written purely in PHP


This is an Authoritative DNS Server written in pure PHP.
It will listen to DNS request on the default port (Default: port 53) and give answers about any domain that it has DNS records for.
This class can be used to give DNS responses dynamically based on your pre-existing PHP code.
