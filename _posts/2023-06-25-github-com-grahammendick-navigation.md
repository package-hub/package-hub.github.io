### Scene-Based Navigation for React and React Native

Scene-Based Navigation for React and React Native
* **Scene-Based Navigation** Native apps have always had scene-based navigation. The Navigation router is the first to bring it to the web. You give the Navigation router a list of your scenes. After you navigate to a scene, the Navigation router gets out of your way so you can build your UI however you want.
* **React and React Native** You don't need a different routing library for React and React Native anymore. The Navigation router works on both. What's more, it doesn't compromise the UX. On React Native, the navigation is 100% native on Android and iOS. On React, you can have whatever URLs you want.
