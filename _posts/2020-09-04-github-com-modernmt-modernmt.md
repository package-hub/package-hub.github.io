### Neural Adaptive Machine Translation that adapts to context and learns from corrections.

ModernMT is a context-aware, incremental and distributed general purpose Neural Machine Translation technology based on **Fairseq Transformer model**. ModernMT is:
- Easy to use and scale with respect to domains, data, and users.
- Trained by pooling all available projects/customers data and translation memories in one folder.
- Queried by providing the sentence to be translated and optionally some context text.

ModernMT goal is to deliver the quality of multiple custom engines by adapting on the fly to the provided context.
