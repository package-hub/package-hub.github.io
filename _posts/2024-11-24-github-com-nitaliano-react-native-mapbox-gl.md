### A Mapbox GL react native module for creating custom maps


This repository is no longer actively maintained. 

Continued development of react-native-mapbox-gl may be found in the community driven repository at [https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps](https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps). This new repository uses the latest versions of the Mapbox SDKs for iOS and Android, and contains a long range of improvements over the current one. We recommend you review the [changelog](https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the new repository and transition to it.

This repository will _only_ accept PRs containing bug fixes. Any new feature development will happen in the new repository.
