### 💫  Models for the spaCy Natural Language Processing (NLP) library


This repository contains
[releases](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases) of models for
the [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) NLP library. For more info on
how to download, install and use the models, see the [models
documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/models).

> **⚠️ Important note:** Because the models can be very large and consist mostly
> of binary data, we can't simply provide them as files in a GitHub repository.
> Instead, we've opted for adding them to
> [releases](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases) as `.whl` and
> `.tar.gz` files. This allows us to still maintain a public release history.
