## [normalise](https://github.com/EFord36/normalise)

### A module for normalising text.


This module takes a text as input, and returns it in a normalised form, *ie.* expands all word tokens deemed not to be of a standard type. Non-standard words (NSWs) are detected, classified and expanded. Examples of NSWs that are normalised include:

* Numbers - percentages, dates, currency amounts, ranges, telephone numbers.
* Abbreviations and acronyms.
* Web addresses and hashtags.
