> [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/) is a natural evolution of this boilerplate, and improves on it in every way. In a single dependency, you get a friendly command line project creation and build tool with development & production modes. Preact CLI requires _no configuration at all_, and even does **automatic code-splitting** without you lifting a finger!  It also produces bundles roughly half the size of preact-boilerplate.
