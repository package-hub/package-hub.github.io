### A developer blog starter for 2021 (Next.js + React + TypeScript + Markdown + syntax highlighting)


- Works as a Markdown-based static-site generator out of the box: just add new blog posts to `/md/blog`
- Supports exporting to fully static assets (powered by Next.js)
- Hot reload (powered by Next.js)
- Makes it easy to write custom pages/code in React + TypeScript
- Provides a `Markdown.tsx` component with support for GitHub-style syntax highlighting
- Automatic RSS feed generation
- SEO best practices (title tag, meta tags, canonical URLs)
