### pwntools on Ruby!


Always sad when playing CTF that there's nothing equivalent to pwntools in Python.
While pwntools is awesome, I always love Ruby far more than Python...
So this is an attempt to create such library.

Would try to have consistent naming with original pwntools, and do things in Ruby style.
