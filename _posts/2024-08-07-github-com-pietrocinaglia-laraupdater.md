### LaraUpdater allows your Laravel Application to auto-update itself: Laravel App Self-Update.


LaraUpdater allows your Laravel application to auto-update itself ! ;)

When you release an application is most important maintain it; therefore, could be necessary to publish an update for bugs fixing as well as for new features implementation.

You deploy your App for several users:

WITHOUT LaraUpdate => Do you want to contact them one by one and send them the update using an email or a link ? ...mmm...very bad becouse each user (with admin role) have to overwrite manually all files on his deployment; or, you have to access manually all deployments (e.g. using FTP) and install for them the update.
