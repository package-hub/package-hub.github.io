### Tea is a humanized programming language.


Tea is a programming language with strong specification design, simple strong type system and unit module system, supporting type inference, object-oriented and functional programming, and concise syntax. The goal is to become a friendly programming language that supports multi terminal development, and supports the common programming language ecology as far as possible, so that developers can continue to use the existing work results. At present, the PHP library can be called by translating it into PHP code, which can be used for web server-side development. It is expected that some other programming language ecology will be supported in the future.

Tea attaches great importance to the friendliness of syntax. By optimizing the syntax, it hopes that developers can write code more easily and naturally, and can focus more on creative implementation. It also tries to keep the grammar style and habit of common programming language to reduce the learning cost.
