### Generate bash completion scripts using a simple configuration file


Completely is a command line utility and a Ruby library that lets you generate
bash completion scripts from simple YAML configuration.

This tool is for you if:

1. You develop your own command line tools.
2. Your life feels empty without bash completions.
3. Bash completion scripts seem overly complex to you.

Note that if you are building bash command line scripts with [bashly][bashly],
then this functionality is already integrated with it.
