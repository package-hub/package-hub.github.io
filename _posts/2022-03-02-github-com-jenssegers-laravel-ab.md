## [laravel-ab](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-ab)

### A server-side A/B testing tool for Laravel.


This is your Laravel database connection that is used to store the A/B testing data. This is handy when you want to store the A/B testing data in a different database. When empty, it will use your default database connection.

    'connection' => 'mysql',
