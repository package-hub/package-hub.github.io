### A desktop CSV editor for data publishers


[Comma Chameleon](https://comma-chameleon.io/) is a desktop CSV editor (built with [Electron.js](electron.atom.io)) that provides a simple interface for editing data. 

Developed by the ODI as a proof of concept, it has now been replaced by [Data Curator](https://theodi.org.au/data-curator/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator)).
