### Brokk brings code intelligence to AI


Brokk (the [Norse god of the forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokkr))
is the first code assistant that understands code semantically, not just
as chunks of text.  Brokk is designed to allow LLMs to work effectively
on large codebases that cannot be jammed entirely into working context.

There is a [Brokk Discord](https://discord.gg/QjhQDK8kAj) for questions and suggestions.
