### Neural Architecture Search Powered by Swarm Intelligence üêú


DeepSwarm is an open-source library which uses Ant Colony Optimization to tackle the neural architecture search problem. The main goal of DeepSwarm is to automate one of the most tedious and daunting tasks, so people can spend more of their time on more important and interesting things. DeepSwarm offers a powerful configuration system which allows you to fine-tune the search space to your needs.
