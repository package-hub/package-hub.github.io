## [A-Pathfinding-Visualization](https://github.com/DevonCrawford/A-Pathfinding-Visualization)

### First attempt at an efficient pathfinding algorithm in Java. I made this visualization to show the beauty of pathfinding. You can modify all major features of my algorithm through the graphics interface.


This is my first attempt at A* pathfinding. I made this visualization to show the beauty of pathfinding. You can modify all major features of my algorithm through the graphics interface. Here I will go through the major features of my program.
