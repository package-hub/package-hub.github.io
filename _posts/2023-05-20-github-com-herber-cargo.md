## [cargo](https://github.com/herber/cargo)

### ðŸš‚ðŸš‹ðŸš‹ A browser with almost no UI.


 - __Chrome__: Cargo uses electron's webview tags, which are powered by chromium.
 - __Tabs__: Like any other browser cargo supports tabs, but it hides them from you.
 - __Devtools__: Cargo has full support for chrome's devtools.
 - __Cross platform__: Cargo looks good on all platforms, even the titlebar on windows looks good.
 - __Simple__: Cargo only has the features most people need.
 - __Tab restore__: Cargo will automatically restore your previously opened tabs, when you open it.
 - __Very cute__: ðŸš‚ðŸš‹ðŸš‹ Cargo(delivering the web to your home).
