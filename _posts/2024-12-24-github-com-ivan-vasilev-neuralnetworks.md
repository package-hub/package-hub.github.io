### java deep learning algorithms and deep neural networks with gpu acceleration


**Update**
_This is a newer version of the framework, that I developed while working at ExB Research. Currently, you can build the project, but some of the tests are not working. If you want to access the previous version it's available in the [old branch](https://github.com/ivan-vasilev/neuralnetworks/tree/old)._

This is a Java implementation of some of the algorithms for training deep neural networks. GPU support is provided via the OpenCL and Aparapi.
The architecture is designed with modularity, extensibility and pluggability in mind.
