### Java bindings for GStreamer 1.x


See the [examples repository][gst1-examples] for some self-contained projects to
get you started. Use the [Javadoc][gst1-javadoc]! - all classes are documented,
and include links to the relevant native documentation where appropriate. Please use the
[GStreamer-Java mailing list][gstreamer-java-group] to ask questions.

To try the examples you will need [GStreamer installed][gstreamer-download] on your
system. Other options for deployment are possible - see requirements below.

Please note, this is not an easy-to-use multimedia framework for beginners. It currently
requires people to know the Java language and be familiar with the GStreamer framework
(and possibly be prepared to apply things from tutorials on GStreamer programming in
other languages to the Java bindings).
