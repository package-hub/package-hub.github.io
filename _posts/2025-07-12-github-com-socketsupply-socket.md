## [socket](https://github.com/socketsupply/socket)

### A cross-platform runtime for Web developers to build desktop & mobile apps for any OS using any frontend library.


Web Developers use `Socket runtime` to create apps for any OS, desktop, and mobile. You can use plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your favorite front-end libraries like Next.js, React, Svelte, or Vue.  

The `Socket runtime CLI` outputs hybrid native-web apps that combine your code with the runtime. Your code is rendered using the OS's native "WebView" component. Platform features are implemented natively and made available to the JavaScript environment in a way that is secure and fully sandboxed on every platform. Native APIs like Bluetooth and UDP make local-first and peer-to-peer software design patterns as first class considerations.
