### Golo - a lightweight dynamic language for the JVM.


> The world didn't need another JVM language.
> So we built yet another one. A simple one.

Golo is a simple dynamic, weakly-typed language for the JVM.

Built from day 1 with `invokedynamic`, Golo takes advantage of the latest advances of
the JVM. It is also a showcase on how to build a language runtime with `invokedynamic`.

Eclipse Golo was originally created by [Julien Ponge](https://julien.ponge.org/)
and developed as part of the research activities of the
[DynaMid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr/) group of the
[CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) at
[INSA Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/).

Eclipse Golo is a _mature_ Eclipse Technology Project.
