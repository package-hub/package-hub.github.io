### Document server for onlyoffice


This is a easy way to get ONLYOFFICE integrated in Nextcloud. It is developed purely as a way for home users to not have to deal with docker images, reverse proxies and other things. It is not aimed at anything beyond that - if you need it to scale, use the docker image, packages or other methods, those will always be faster and more scalable.

The work on this was sponsored by Nextcloud GmbH for the private home user community. There is no commercial support available and there will not be.
