### Native features for mobile apps built with Cordova/PhoneGap and open web technologies. Complete with TypeScript support. 


Awesome Cordova Plugins is a curated set of wrappers for Cordova plugins that make adding any native functionality you need to your [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) mobile app easy.

Awesome Cordova Plugins wraps plugin callbacks in a Promise or Observable, providing a common interface for all plugins and making it easy to use plugins with Angular change detection.

To learn more about the reasons why Ionic Native was renamed to Awesome Cordova Plugins, read the official [Ionic blog](https://ionicframework.com/blog/a-new-chapter-for-ionic-native/) post by Max Lyncht.
