### YOLO Object detection with OpenCV and Python.


OpenCV `dnn` module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow. 

When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are
 * YOLO
 * SSD
 * Faster R-CNN
 
 Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently.
