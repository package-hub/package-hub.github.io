### Shamir's Secret Sharing for people with friends


Banana Split makes your paper backups more resilient and secure using [Shamirâ€™s secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

It splits your secret (e.g., paper backup) into `N` pieces, but only requires a majority of those pieces (`N/2+1`) to recover your secret.
