## [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript)

### Skript is a Bukkit plugin which allows server admins to customize their server easily, but without the hassle of programming a plugin or asking/paying someone to program a plugin for them.

**Skript** is a Minecraft plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people
to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you
*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used
for prototyping etc.

This Github fork of Skript is based on Mirreski's improvements which was built
on Njol's original Skript.
