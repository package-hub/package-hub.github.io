### A fast and lightweight TR-069 Auto Configuration Server (ACS)


GenieACS is a high performance Auto Configuration Server (ACS) for remote
management of TR-069 enabled devices. It utilizes a declarative and fault
tolerant configuration engine for automating complex provisioning scenarios at
scale. It's battle-tested to handle hundreds of thousands and potentially
millions of concurrent devices.
