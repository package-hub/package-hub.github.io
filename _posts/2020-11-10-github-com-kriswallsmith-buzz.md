## [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz)

### PHP's lightweight HTTP client


Install by running:

```bash
composer require kriswallsmith/buzz
```

You do also need to install a PSR-17 request/response factory. Buzz uses that factory
to create PSR-7 requests and responses. Install one from [this list](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation).

Example: 

```bash
composer require nyholm/psr7
```
