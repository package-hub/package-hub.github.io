### Seasons, absolute mode, Subfolders...

A Plex Series Scanner makes the video files showing in Plex and populate the following for the video files:
- Series name (including forced id passed to agent search() function)
- Series year (optional)
- Season number
- Episode number
- Episode title (not filled by plex default series scanner, but ASS fills it, but this will be overwritten by the metadata agent)

If a file is not showing in plex or showing at the wrong season and/or episode number, or is not passing through the forced id, then it is a scanner issue. Anything else is metadata related and agent specific.

If you post anything on the scanner github or thread for any issue like poster missing/wrong, episode thumbnail/screenshot/title/summary missing/wrong, then you clearly haven't read this and need to pay the RTFM tax by donating (or you just find this the best anime scanner and/or agent, much apreciated average is 5 euros). Also applies if you want assistance but didn't follow troubleshooting steps or include logs...
