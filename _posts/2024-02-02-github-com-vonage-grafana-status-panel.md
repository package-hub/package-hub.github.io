## [Grafana_Status_panel](https://github.com/Vonage/Grafana_Status_panel)

### A panel plugin for Grafana to monitor multiple parameters at once


This is a plugin meant to be used as a centralized view for the status of component in a glance.
It is very similar to the Single Stat panel, but it can hold multiple values from the same data source.
Each value can be used to customize the panel in different ways: 

* Mark the severity of the component
* Mark if the component is disabled
* Show extra data in the panel about the component
