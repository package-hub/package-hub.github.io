## [strongbox](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox)

### Strongbox is an artifact repository manager.


Strongbox is a modern OSS artifact repository manager. With a well-developed architecture, it provides native 
implementations for various layout formats, such as [Maven][docs-maven], [NPM][docs-npm], [NuGet][docs-nuget], and [Raw][docs-raw].

All of the implemented layout formats (a.k.a. "[layout providers][docs-providers]") are written natively in Java. 
Our goal is to implement a universal repository manager that can host and serve artifacts in every mainstream format.

Strongbox has a search engine and an [Artifact Query Language][docs-aql].
