### Source for the demo app API in Serverless-Stack.com


[Serverless Stack](http://serverless-stack.com) is a free comprehensive guide to creating full-stack serverless applications. We create a [note taking app](http://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch.

This repo is for the serverless backend API that we build over the course of the tutorial. You can find the repo for the frontend React app [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-client). And the repo for the tutorial [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com).

This repo is split into:

- **services**: [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) services
- **infrastructure**: An [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack) app
