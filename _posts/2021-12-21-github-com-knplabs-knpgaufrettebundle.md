## [KnpGaufretteBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle)

### Easily use Gaufrette in your Symfony projects.


As this bundle is an integration for Symfony of the [Gaufrette][gaufrette-homepage] library, it requires you to first install [Gaufrette][gaufrette-homepage] in your project.

Note that, you need to install separately the adapters you want to use. You can find more details about these packages [here](https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette#metapackages-for-adapters),
and the full list adapters [on packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/gaufrette/).
