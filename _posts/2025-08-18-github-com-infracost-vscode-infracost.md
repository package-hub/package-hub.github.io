### See cost estimates for Terraform right in your editorðŸ’°ðŸ“‰


Infracost's VS Code extension shows you cost estimates for Terraform right in your editor! Prevent costly infrastructure changes before they get into production.

This helps with a few use-cases:
- **Compare configs, instance types, regions etc**: copy/paste a code block, make changes and compare them.
- **Quick cost estimate**: write a code block and get a cost estimate without having to use AWS, Azure or Google cost calculators, or read the long/complicated pricing web pages.
- **Catch costly typos**: if you accidentally type 22 instead of 2 as the instance count, or 1000GB volume size instead of 100, the cost estimate will immediately pick that up and let you know.
