### Converts an audio stream to speech events in the browser


Hark is a tiny browser/commonJS module that listens to an audio stream, and emits events indicating whether the user is speaking or not.

With browserify:

`npm install hark`

Without browserify download and use:

[hark.bundle.js](https://raw.github.com/otalk/hark/master/hark.bundle.js)
