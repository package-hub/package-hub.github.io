### A Javascript Membrane implementation using Proxies to observe mutation on an object graph


Creating robust JavaScript code becomes increasingly important as web applications become more sophisticated. The dynamic nature of JavaScript code at runtime has always presented challenges for developers.

This package implements an observable membrane in JavaScript using Proxies.

A membrane can be created to observe access to a module graph and observe what the other part is attempting to do with certain objects.
