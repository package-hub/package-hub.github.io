### multiple GNOME terminals in one window


Terminator was originally developed by Chris Jones in 2007 as a simple, 300-ish line python script.  Since then, it has become The Robot Future of Terminals.  Originally inspired by projects like quadkonsole and gnome-multi-term and more recently by projects like Iterm2, and Tilix, It lets you combine and recombine terminals to suit the style you like.  If you live at the command-line, or are logged into 10 different remote machines at once, you should definitely try out Terminator.

When you run **`Terminator`**, you will get a terminal in a window, just like almost 
every other terminal emulator available. There is also a titlebar which will
update as shells/programs inside the terminal tell it to. Also on the titlebar
is a small button that opens the grouping menu. From here you can put terminals
into groups, which allows you to control multiple terminals simultaneously.
