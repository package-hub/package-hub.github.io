### Make motion interpolated and fluid slow motion videos from the command line.

BF is a video manipulation tool that can:

1. Make **motion interpolated videos** (increase a video's frame rate by rendering intermediate frames based on motion using a combination of pixel-warping and blending).
2. Make **smooth motion videos** (do simple blending between frames).
3. Leverage interpolated frames to make **fluid slow motion videos**.
