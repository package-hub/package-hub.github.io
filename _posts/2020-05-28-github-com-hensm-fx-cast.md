### Implementation of the Google Cast Chrome Sender SDK within Firefox


Firefox extension that implements the [Chrome sender API](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/chrome/) and exposes it to web apps to enable cast support. Communication with receiver devices is handled by a native application (bridge). Check the [implementation notes](IMPLEMENTATION.md) for more info.

_**Note**: No full public release yet! Pre-release beta version is incomplete and likely buggy._
