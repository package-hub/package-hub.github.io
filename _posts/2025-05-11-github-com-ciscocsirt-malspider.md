## [malspider](https://github.com/ciscocsirt/malspider)

### Malspider is a web spidering framework that detects characteristics of web compromises. 

Malspider has built-in detection for characteristics of compromise like hidden iframes, reconnaisance frameworks, vbscript injection, email address disclosure, etc. As we find stuff we will continue to add classifications to this tool and we hope you will do the same. Malspider will be a much better tool if CIRT teams and security practioners around the world contribute to the project.
