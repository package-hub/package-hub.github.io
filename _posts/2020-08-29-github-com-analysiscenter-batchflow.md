### BatchFlow helps you conveniently work with random or sequential batches of your data and define data processing and machine learning workflows even for datasets that do not fit into memory.


`BatchFlow` helps you conveniently work with random or sequential batches of your data
and define data processing and machine learning workflows even for datasets that do not fit into memory.

For more details see [the documentation and tutorials](https://analysiscenter.github.io/batchflow/).

Main features:
- flexible batch generaton
- deterministic and stochastic pipelines
- datasets and pipelines joins and merges
- data processing actions
- flexible model configuration
- within batch parallelism
- batch prefetching
- ready to use ML models and proven NN architectures
- convenient layers and helper functions to build custom models
- a powerful research engine with parallel model training and extended experiment logging.
