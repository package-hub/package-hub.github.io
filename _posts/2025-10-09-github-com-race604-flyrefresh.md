## [FlyRefresh](https://github.com/race604/FlyRefresh)

### The implementation of https://dribbble.com/shots/2067564-Replace

The Android implementation of [Replace](https://dribbble.com/shots/2067564-Replace), designed by [Zee Youn](https://dribbble.com/zeeyoung).
I implement this as a **FlyRefresh** layout. The content of the layout can be any `NestedScrollingChild`, such as a RecyclerView, NestedScrollView, VerticalGridView, etc.
This library can also work with `NestedScrollingParent` as parent, such as CoordinatorLayout.
