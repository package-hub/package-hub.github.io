### Welcome to the Bot Framework SDK for JavaScript repository, which is the home for the libraries and packages that enable developers to build sophisticated bot applications using JavaScript. 


This repository contains code for the JavaScript version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. 

This SDK enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using JavaScript. SDKs for [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python) and [Java (preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) are also available.

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).  If you are an existing user, then you can also [find out what's new with Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).
