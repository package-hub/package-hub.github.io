You will most likely find a better more actively maintained fork here https://github.com/yajra/laravel-datatables

If you have issues please try and fix them and we will pull the changes if we can verify they work. That being said this project lacks automatic testing so it has become a difficult project to maintain. Please let us know if you are interested in adopting and maintaining this project, it is still pretty useful. 60% of the time, it works every time.
