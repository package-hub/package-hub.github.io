### Unify your EmberCLI and Rails Workflows


Unify your EmberCLI and Rails Workflows!

EmberCLI-Rails is designed to give you the best of both worlds:

* Stay up to date with the latest JavaScript technology and EmberCLI addons
* Develop your Rails API and Ember front-ends from within a single process
* Inject Rails-generated content into your EmberCLI application
* Avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing gotchas by serving your EmberCLI
  applications and your API from a single domain
* Write truly end-to-end integration tests, exercising your application's entire
  stack through JavaScript-enabled Capybara tests
* Deploy your entire suite of applications to Heroku with a single `git push`

If you're having trouble, checkout the [example project]!

**EmberCLI-Rails Supports EmberCLI 1.13.13 and later.**
