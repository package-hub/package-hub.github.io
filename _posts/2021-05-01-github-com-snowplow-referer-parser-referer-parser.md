## [referer-parser](https://github.com/snowplow-referer-parser/referer-parser)

### Library for extracting marketing attribution data from referrer URLs


referer-parser is a database for extracting marketing attribution data (such as search terms) from referer URLs, inspired by the [ua-parser][ua-parser] project (an equivalent library for user agent parsing).

The referer-parser project also contains multiple libraries for working with the referer-parser database in different languages.

referer-parser is a core component of [Snowplow][snowplow], the open-source web-scale analytics platform powered by Hadoop and Redshift.

_Note that we always use the original HTTP misspelling of 'referer' (and thus 'referal') in this project - never 'referrer'._
