## [tesla-api](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api)

### ðŸš˜ A Ruby gem and unofficial documentation of Tesla's JSON API for the Model S, 3, X, and Y.


[View Documentation](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/)

This is unofficial documentation of the Tesla JSON API used by the iOS and Android apps.
The API provides functionality to monitor and control the Model S (and future Tesla vehicles) remotely.
The project provides both a documentation of the API and a Ruby library for accessing it.

> If any folks at Tesla are reading this, I'd love to help coordinate a developer program for your APIs. If there's any way I can be helpful, please feel free to get in contact. Also, I'd love to be in the beta firmware program :wink:
