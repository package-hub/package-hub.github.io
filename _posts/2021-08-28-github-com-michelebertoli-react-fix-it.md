### Automagically generate tests from errors

Automagically generate tests from errors.

:warning: This package uses [react-component-errors](https://github.com/staxmanade/react-component-errors) to wrap the lifecycle methods into a try...catch block, which affects the performance of your components. Therefore it should **not** be used in production.
