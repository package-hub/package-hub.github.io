## [php-font-lib](https://github.com/dompdf/php-font-lib)

### A library to read, parse, export and make subsets of different types of font files.


This library can be used to:
 * Read TrueType, OpenType (with TrueType glyphs), WOFF font files
 * Extract basic info (name, style, etc)
 * Extract advanced info (horizontal metrics, glyph names, glyph shapes, etc)
 * Make an Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) file from a font

This project was initiated by the need to read font files in the [DOMPDF project](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf).
