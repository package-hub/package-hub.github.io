### CeSI is a web interface for managing multiple supervisors from the same place.


CeSI is a web interface for managing multiple [supervisors][1] from the same
place.

Supervisor has its own web UI but managing multiple supervisor installations is
hard with seperate UIs (If you are using the UI of course :). CeSI aims to solve
this problem by creating a centralized web UI, based on the RPC interface of
Supervisor.
