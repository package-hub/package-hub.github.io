### Development of a Roboto Variable font


This is a variable version of Roboto intended to be a 1:1 match with the official non-variable release from Google.

This is not an official Google project, but was enabled with generous funding by Google Fonts, who contracted Type Network.
The Roboto family of instances contained 6 weights and two widths of normal, along with italic of the regular width.
The project began by taking UFO instances generated during the build process of the Roboto v2.136 release, which have quadratic outlines. 
The Thin, Regular and Bold UFOs required some fixes for interpolation compatibility, and a build script was written that preserves outline overlaps.

* [/sources](sources/) contains 'new' source UFOs (compared to the 'old' UFOs used in the static-only era of the project).

* [github.com/TypeNetwork/Roboto/releases](https://github.com/TypeNetwork/Roboto/releases) contains variation font TTFs.

Both fonts have named instances for all the styles in the v2.136 release.
