### A MySQL engine written in pure PHP


PHP MySQL Engine is a library for PHP that allows you to test database-driven applications with an in-memory simulation of MySQL 5.6. This project extends the `PDO` class and allows you to call common PDO MySQL methods. It supports a wide variety of queries, and some PDO-specific functionality like transactions and different fetch modes.

PHP MySQL Engine is based on Slack's [Hack SQL Fake](https://github.com/slackhq/hack-sql-fake) created by [Scott Sandler](https://github.com/ssandler).
