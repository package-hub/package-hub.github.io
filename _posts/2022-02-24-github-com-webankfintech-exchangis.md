### Exchangis is a lightweight,highly extensible data exchange platform that supports data transmission between structured and unstructured heterogeneous data sources

Exchangis is a lightweight,highly extensible data exchange platform that supports data transmission between structured and unstructured heterogeneous data sources. On the application layer, it has business features such as data permission management and control, high availability of node services and multi-tenant resource isolation. On the data layer, it also has architectural characteristics such as diversified transmission architecture, module plug-in and low coupling of components.

Exchnagis's transmission and exchange capabilities depend on its underlying aggregated transmission engines. It defines a unified parameter model for various data sources on the top layer. It maps and configures the parameter model for each transmission engine, and then converts it into the engine's input model. Each type of engine will add Exchangis features, and  the enhancement of certain engine features will improve the Exchangis features. Exchangis's default engine aggregated and enhanced is Alibaba's DataX transmission engine.
