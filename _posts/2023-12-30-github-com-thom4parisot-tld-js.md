## [tld.js](https://github.com/thom4parisot/tld.js)

### JavaScript API to work easily with complex domain names, subdomains and well-known TLDs.


> `tld.js` is a Node.js module written in JavaScript to work against complex domain names, subdomains and well-known TLDs.

It answers with accuracy to questions like _what is `mail.google.com`'s domain?_,  _what is `a.b.ide.kyoto.jp`'s subdomain?_ and _is `https://big.data`'s TLD a well-known one?_.

`tld.js` [runs fast](#performances), is fully tested and is safe to use in the browser (with [browserify][], webpack and others). Because it relies on Mozilla's [public suffix list][], now is a good time to say _thank you_ Mozilla!
