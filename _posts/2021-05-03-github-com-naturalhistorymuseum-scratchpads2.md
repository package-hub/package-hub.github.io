### Scratchpads 2.0


Scratchpads are an online virtual research environment for biodiversity,
allowing anyone to share their data and create their own research networks.
Sites are hosted at the Natural History Museum London, and offered freely to
any scientist that completes an online [registration
form](http://get.scratchpads.eu).

Sites can focus on specific taxonomic groups, or the biodiversity of a
biogeographic region, or indeed any aspect of natural history. Scratchpads are
also suitable for societies or for managing and presenting projects. Key
features of Scratchpads (see also Scratchpads feature list) include: tools to
manage biological classifications, bibliography management, media (images,
video and audio), rich taxon pages (with structured descriptions, specimen
records, and distribution data), and character matrices.

Scratchpads support various ways of communicating with site members and
visitors such as blogs, forums, newsletters and a commenting system.
