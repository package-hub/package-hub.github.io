### Generate a Postman collection automatically from your Laravel API


This package allows you to automatically generate a Postman collection based on your API routes. It also provides basic configuration and support for bearer auth tokens and basic auth for routes behind an auth middleware.

For ```POST``` and ```PUT``` requests that utilizes a FormRequest, you can optionally scaffold the request, and publish rules in raw or human readable format.
