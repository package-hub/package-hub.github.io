### Wordpress plugin for serving autogenerated WebP images instead of jpeg/png to browsers that supports WebP


Serve autogenerated WebP images instead of jpeg/png to browsers that supports WebP.

The plugin is available on the Wordpress codex ([here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webp-express/)).
But well, it is developed ([here on github](https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-express/)).

**News: I have added the vendor folder to the repo. To install the plugin here from github, you can simply download the zip and unzip it in your plugin folder**
