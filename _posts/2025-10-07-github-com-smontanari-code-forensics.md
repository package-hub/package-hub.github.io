### A toolset for code analysis and report visualisation

This release introduces new metrics trends in the system evolution analysis (number of commits, number of authors). This change requires a different logic to generate and render the revisions trend diagram, which breaks compatibility with respect to older versions. See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for more details.
