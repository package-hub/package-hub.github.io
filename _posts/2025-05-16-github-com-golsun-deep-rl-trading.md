### playing idealized trading games with deep reinforcement learning


This repo is the code for this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03916). Deep reinforcement learing is used to find optimal strategies in these two scenarios:
* Momentum trading: capture the underlying dynamics
* Arbitrage trading: utilize the hidden relation among the inputs

Several neural networks are compared: 
* Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU/LSTM)
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Multi-Layer Perception (MLP)
