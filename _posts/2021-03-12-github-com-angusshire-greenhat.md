### :construction_worker: Quick hack for making real work happen.

greenhat is a quick hack for decorating your GitHub contribution calendar with commits for the past `n` days. It uses the `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` and `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` environmental variables to make commits appear in the past. Be warned that greenhat will clobber your repository's commit history.
