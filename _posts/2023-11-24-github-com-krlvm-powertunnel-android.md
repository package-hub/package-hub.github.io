### Powerful and extensible proxy server with anti-censorship functionality for Android

PowerTunnel is an extensible proxy server built on top of [LittleProxy](https://github.com/adamfisk/LittleProxy) that does not require root-access to work.

PowerTunnel provides an SDK that allows you to extend its functionality however you like, and even handle encrypted HTTPS traffic (powered by [LittleProxy-MITM](https://github.com/ganskef/LittleProxy-mitm)), which can be especially useful in web development. PowerTunnel has an Android version, so any plugin you write can work on almost all devices.


PowerTunnel was originally developed and is best known as a censorship bypass tool. This functionality has been spun off in the [LibertyTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/LibertyTunnel) plugin, it is installed by default, just like [DNS Resolver](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-DNS) with DNS over HTTPS support.
