### A Home Assistant Component to interface with the WYZE Sense hub and sensor system

Hi all, I'm unable to maintain this component anymore due to time constraints. Unfortunately, there is a fatal issue with these sensors that has appeared over the year. They can die permanently if the battery gets too low, https://twitter.com/WyzeCam/status/1321147804610252800. Wyze is no longer selling wyze sense v1. If and when new sensors come out, I will try to create a component for those. Apologies to all who have bought these sensors, it seems like the sensors themselves are flawed, leading to a ton of issues after a year, and this component can't do much about it.

I recommend upvoting this thread on the wyze forums so that wyze knows we want an official wyzesense integration: https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/home-assistant-integration/3971
