### A high performance "thin wrapper" HTTP REST server on top of Apache Lucene


This project provides a simple, example HTTP server on top of [Apache
Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org) version 6.x snapshot sources,
exposing many of Lucene's core and modules functionality efficiently
over a simple REST/JSON HTTP API.

Note that this code is all very new and likely has exciting bugs!  But
it's also very fast!

This server is running "in production" at [Jira
search](http://jirasearch.mikemccandless.com), a simple search
instance for developers to find Lucene, Solr and Tika jira issues
updated in near-real-time.
