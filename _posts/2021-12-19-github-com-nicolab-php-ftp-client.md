### A flexible FTP and SSL-FTP client for PHP


A flexible FTP and SSL-FTP client for PHP.
This lib provides helpers easy to use to manage the remote files.

> This package is aimed to remain simple and light. It's only a wrapper of the FTP native API of PHP, with some useful helpers. If you want to customize some methods, you can do this by inheriting one of the [3 classes of the package](src/FtpClient).
