### Wordpress Vulnerability Scanner


A Wordpress Scanner written in PHP, focus on vulnerability assessment and security audit of misconfiguration in the Wordpress installation.
Wordpress Scanner is capable of finding the flaws in the Wordpress installation and will provide all the information regarding the vulnerability.
Wordpress Scanner is not a tool for code auditing, it performs "black box" scanning for the Wordpress powered web application.

The basic security check will review a WordPress installation for common security related mis-configurations. Testing with the basic check option uses regular web requests.
The system downloads a handful of pages from the target site, then performs analysis on the resulting html source.
