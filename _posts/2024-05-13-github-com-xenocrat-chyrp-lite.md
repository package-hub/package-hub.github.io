## [chyrp-lite](https://github.com/xenocrat/chyrp-lite)

### An ultra-lightweight blogging engine, written in PHP.


Chyrp Lite makes it possible to host a blog on your own web server with minimal fuss. You can have
a traditional blog, a tumbleblog, or you can add oodles of customisation and build a general-purpose
web publishing platform with blogging features on the side. You get five beautiful blog themes and
a friendly administration console, all fully navigable on a broad range of devices, thanks to the
power of responsive HTML5. Semantic markup and comprehensive ARIA labelling ensure your blog will be
accessible to visitors who use assistive technologies.

With a flexible system of Feathers and Pages, you can make your website whatever you want it to be.
Feathers enable different types of blog content – you can restrict yourself to absolute textual purity,
or you can create a multimedia rainbow. Pages let you publish articles separate from your blog content
– be it a simple colophon or a hierarchy of multiple pages, optionally including a homepage that your
visitors will see when they first arrive at your website.
