### A simple Rails wrapper for Google Material Icons


[Material Design Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) is a **+900 set of icons** based on Material Design guidelines. You can check all the icons in the [official site](https://material.io/icons/).

**This gem helps you to add this fantastic icon collection to your Rails projects easily**. I keep the gem updated so you always will have the latest icons in your project.
