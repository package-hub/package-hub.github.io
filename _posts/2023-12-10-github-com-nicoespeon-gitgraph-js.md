### ðŸ‘‹ [Looking for maintainers] - A JavaScript library to draw pretty git graphs in the browser


GitGraph.js codebase is a monorepo. Packages are released under `@gitgraph/*` scope.

As a user, you're probably interested in one of the rendering libraries:

- [gitgraph-js][gitgraph-js]
- [gitgraph-react][gitgraph-react]
- [gitgraph-node][gitgraph-node]

You'll find usage details in their README.

As a contributor, you might be interested in checking out [gitgraph-core][gitgraph-core]. It contains the core logic for rendering libraries to use.
