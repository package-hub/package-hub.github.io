## [yii2-eauth](https://github.com/Nodge/yii2-eauth)

### EAuth extension allows to authenticate users by the OpenID, OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 providers.

The implementation of the authorization on your own server has several advantages:

* Full control over the process: What will be written in the authorization window, what data we get, etc.
* Ability to change the appearance of the widget.
* When logging in via OAuth, it is possible to invoke methods on the API.
* Fewer dependencies on third-party services - more reliable application.
