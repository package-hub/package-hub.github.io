### command line tool for Apache Lucene


When working with Lucene, it is often useful to inspect an index.

[Luke](http://www.getopt.org/luke/) is awesome, but often times it is not feasible to inspect an index on a remote machine using a GUI. That's where Clue comes in.
You can ssh into your production box and inspect your index using your favorite shell.

Another important feature for Clue is the ability to interact with other Unix commands via piping, e.g. grep, more etc.
