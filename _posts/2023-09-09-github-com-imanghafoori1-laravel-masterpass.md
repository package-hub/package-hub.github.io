## [laravel-MasterPass](https://github.com/imanghafoori1/laravel-MasterPass)

### Helps you securely setup a master password and login into user accounts with it.



Helps you set a master password in .env file and login into any account with that, to impersonate your users.

This means that each account will have 2 valid passwords. The original one and the master password.

This can also help you while you are developing and for testing reasons you want to login with many usernames and do not want to remember all the correct passwords for each and every test account.

- Also works if you use laravel-passport (as of version 2.0.6 and above)
