### GPU-Accelerated Deep Learning Library in Python


GPU-Accelerated Deep Learning Library in Python

Hebel is a library for deep learning with neural networks in Python using GPU acceleration with CUDA through PyCUDA. It implements the most important types of neural network models and offers a variety of different activation functions and training methods such as momentum, Nesterov momentum, dropout, and early stopping.

I no longer actively develop Hebel. If you are looking for a deep learning framework in Python, I now recommend [Chainer](https://github.com/pfnet/chainer).
