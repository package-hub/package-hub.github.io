### Intellij Plugin for the D Programming Language


The primary focus for the project is to support Intellij IDEA (both IC and IU) with some work being done to try and support CLion. It may work on other IDEs such as AppCode, Android Studio, PyCharm, etc but this is not tested by the dev team.

We are currently targeting *Intellij 2021.2 and above* with the latest plugin release being version *1.27.1*.

For a list of older releases and their supported IDE versions see our [Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage/wiki/Compatibility-Matrix).
