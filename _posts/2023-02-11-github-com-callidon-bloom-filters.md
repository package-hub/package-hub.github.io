### JS implementation of probabilistic data structures: Bloom Filter (and its derived), HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch, Top-K and MinHash


JavaScript/TypeScript implementation of probabilistic data structures: Bloom Filter (and its derived), HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch, Top-K and MinHash.
**This package relies on [non-cryptographic hash functions](https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/)**.

‚ùóÔ∏è**Compatibility**‚ùóÔ∏è

- Be carefull when migrating from a version to another.
- Bug fixes were introduced in `1.3.7` and from `1.3.9` to `2.0.0+` for hashing and indexing data. Then, you **must re-build completely your filters from start** to be compatible with the new versions.
- To keep the `breaking changes` rule of npm versions we will make now new `majored versions` since 1.3.9 whenever a modification is done on the hashing/indexing system or breaks the current API.
