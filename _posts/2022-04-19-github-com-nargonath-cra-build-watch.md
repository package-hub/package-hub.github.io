### A script for create-react-app that writes development builds to the disk


**The builds resulting from this script are NOT for production environment.** They lack various optimizations.

This script is meant as a temporary workaround for `create-react-app` project based until this feature is built-in into `react-scripts`. See [create-react-app#1070](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1070).

This script is inspired by other work related such as: https://gist.github.com/jasonblanchard/ae0d2e304a647cd847c0b4493c2353d4.
