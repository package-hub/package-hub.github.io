### ðŸ”‡ Browser extension to skip silent parts in videos and audio files on any webpage


"Skip Silence" is a browser extension that allows you to automatically skip parts of a video that are silent.
It is highly inspired by CaryKH's [automatic on-the-fly video editing tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw).
The extension works with most websites that use HTML5 `audio` and `video` elements (like YouTube).
