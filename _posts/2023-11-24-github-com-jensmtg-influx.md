## [influx](https://github.com/jensmtg/influx)

### An alternative backlinks plugin, which displays relevant and formatted excerpts from notes with linked mentions, based on the position of mentions in the notes' hierarchical structure (bullet level indentation).

(Or: How to get the most out of this plugin.)

* Information should mainly be written in daily (or Zettelkasten-ish) notes. Topical notes will then mainly be aggregates of clippings from daily notes.
* Notes should be taken hierarchically, in the form of bullet lists/*bullet journaling*. This helps keep clippings terse and relevant.
* Links should be used as the only organizing principle in the vault - forgo use of tags and files/folders. This helps with completeness; the plugin only considers links when aggregating.
