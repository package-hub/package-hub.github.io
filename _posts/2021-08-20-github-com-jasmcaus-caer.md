### High-performance Vision library in Python. Scale your research, not boilerplate. 


Caer is a *lightweight, high-performance* Vision library for high-performance AI research. We wrote this framework to simplify your approach towards Computer Vision by abstracting away unnecessary boilerplate code giving you the **flexibility** to quickly prototype deep learning models and research ideas. The end result is a library quite different in its design, thatâ€™s easy to understand, plays well with others, and is a lot of fun to use.

Our elegant, *type-checked* API and design philosophy makes Caer ideal for students, researchers, hobbyists and even experts in the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
