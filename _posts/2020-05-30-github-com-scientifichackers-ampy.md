### Adafruit MicroPython Tool - Utility to interact with a MicroPython board over a serial connection.


Adafruit MicroPython Tool (ampy) - Utility to interact with a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over a serial connection.

Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython or
MicroPython board over its serial connection.
With ampy you can send files from your computer to the
board's file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python script
to a board to be executed.

Note that ampy by design is meant to be simple and does not support advanced interaction like a shell
or terminal to send input to a board.  Check out other MicroPython tools
like [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell)
or [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell) for more advanced interaction with boards.
