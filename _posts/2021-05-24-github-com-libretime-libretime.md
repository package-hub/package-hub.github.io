### LibreTime: Radio Broadcast & Automation Platform


The LibreTime follows the standardized [Collective Code Construction 
Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/). Its abstract is
provided here.

> C4 provides a standard process for contributing, evaluating and
> discussing improvements on software projects. It defines specific 
> technical requirements for projects like a style guide, unit tests,
> git and similar platforms. It also establishes different personas
> for projects, with clear and distinct duties. C4 specifies a process
> for documenting and discussing issues including seeking consensus
> and clear descriptions, use of "pull requests" and systematic reviews.
