### Source for the demo app API in the Serverless Stack Guide


[Serverless Stack](http://serverless-stack.com) is a free comprehensive guide to creating full-stack serverless applications. We create a [note taking app](http://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch.

The main part of the guide uses [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack). We also have an alternative version that uses Serverless Framework. This repo is the source for the Serverless Framework version of the backend. There's a [frontend React client that connects to this as well](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-client).
