### Build and distribute Linux packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way #obs

The [Open Build Service (OBS)](https://www.openbuildservice.org) is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an automatic, consistent, and reproducible way. You can release packages as well as updates, add-ons, appliances, and entire distributions for a wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures. More information can be found on [openbuildservice.org](https://www.openbuildservice.org).

The OBS consists of a backend and a frontend. The backend implements all the core functionality (i.e. building packages). The frontend provides a web application and XML API for interacting with the backend. Additionally, there is a command line client (osc) for the API which is developed in a [separate repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc).
