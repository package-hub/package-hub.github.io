### Set of Angular directives to simplify creating and validating HTML forms.


Issue reports and pull requests will probably not be attended.

I am no longer working with Angular on a regular basis. My day job has switched to React and it's too much effort to context switch between the frameworks. Given the upcoming Angular 2.0 release it seems like a reasonable time to end support for this library.

Thanks to all of you for using, supporting, and contributing to this project.
