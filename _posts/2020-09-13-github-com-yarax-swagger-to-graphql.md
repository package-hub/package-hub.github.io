### Swagger to GraphQL API adapter


Swagger-to-GraphQL converts your existing Swagger schema to an executable
GraphQL schema where resolvers perform HTTP calls to certain real endpoints. It
allows you to move your API to GraphQL with nearly zero effort and maintain both
REST and GraphQL APIs. Our CLI tool also allows you get the GraphQL schema in
Schema Definition Language.

[Try it](https://0xr.github.io/swagger-to-graphql-web/) online! You can paste in
the url to your own Swagger schema. There are also public OpenAPI schemas
available in the [APIs.guru OpenAPI directory](https://apis.guru/browse-apis/).
