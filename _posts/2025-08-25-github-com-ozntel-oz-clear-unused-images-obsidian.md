### Obsidian plugin to clear the images that are not used in note files anymore


This plugin helps you to keep your vault clean by deleting the images you are not referencing in your markdown notes anymore.

The plugin simply gets all of your image links from all the markdown documents and compares these images with all image files you have available in your vault.

In case any of these image files are not referenced in any document of the vault, they will be automatically deleted.
