## [design-systems-cli](https://github.com/intuit/design-systems-cli)

### A CLI toolbox for creating design systems.


Design-systems-cli is basically a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for design systems.

The main benefit it brings you as a developer is time savings. Setting up all of the monorepo, [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and build tools for a design system takes over a week if you piece it together yourself. You can do it with this project in minutes.
