### Reinforcement learning environments with musculoskeletal models


This repository contains software required for participation in the NeurIPS 2019 Challenge: Learn to Move - Walk Around. See more details about the challenge [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2019-learn-to-move-walk-around). See full documentation of our reinforcement learning environment [here](https://osim-rl.stanford.edu). In this document we will give very basic steps to get you set up for the challenge!

Your task is to develop a controller for a physiologically plausible 3D human model to walk or run following velocity commands with minimum effort. You are provided with a human musculoskeletal model and a physics-based simulation environment, OpenSim. There will be three tracks:

1) **Best performance**
2) **Novel ML solution**
3) **Novel biomechanical solution**, where all the winners of each track will be awarded.

To model physics and biomechanics we use [OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) - a biomechanical physics environment for musculoskeletal simulations.
