## [laravel](https://github.com/backup-manager/laravel)

### Driver to seamlessly integrate the Backup Manager into Laravel applications.


This package pulls in the framework agnostic [Backup Manager](https://github.com/backup-manager/backup-manager) and provides seamless integration with **Laravel**.

[Watch a video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWXy0R8OavM) to get an idea what is possible with this package.

> Note: This package is for Laravel integration only. For information about the framework-agnostic core package (or the Symfony driver) please see [the base package repository](https://github.com/backup-manager/backup-manager).
