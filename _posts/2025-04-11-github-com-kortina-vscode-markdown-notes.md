### Install from: https://ark.dance/md-notes


Use `[[wiki-links]]`, `backlinks`, `#tags` and `@bibtex-citations` for fast-navigation of markdown notes.

Automatically create notes from new inline `[[wiki-links]]`.

Bring some of the awesome features from apps like [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/), [nvalt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/), [Bear](https://bear.app/), [FSNotes](https://fsnot.es/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to VS Code, where you also have (1) Vim key bindings and (2) excellent extensibility.

[Install from the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes). See more in the blog post: [Suping Up VS Code as a Markdown Notebook](https://kortina.nyc/essays/suping-up-vs-code-as-a-markdown-notebook/).
