### A standalone local web based user interface for git repositories


This git extension is a standalone web based user interface for git repositories.

It comes with history and tree browsing. You may also use it to commit
as it comes with an UI to review local changes and the ability to stage / unstage code.

Moreover as git-webui is a web server, your repository is accessible to
other people on the same network. They can clone or pull your code using the
same URL.

It has very few dependencies, you probably already have them on your
Mac / Linux : git, python, and a web browser.
