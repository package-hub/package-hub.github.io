## [ngStorage](https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage)

### localStorage and sessionStorage done right for AngularJS.


* **No Getter 'n' Setter Bullshit** - Right from AngularJS homepage: "Unlike other frameworks, there is no need to [...] wrap the model in accessors methods. Just plain old JavaScript here." Now you can enjoy the same benefit while achieving data persistence with Web Storage.

* **sessionStorage** - We got this often-overlooked buddy covered.

* **Cleanly-Authored Code** - Written in the *Angular Way*, well-structured with testability in mind.

* **No Cookie Fallback** - With Web Storage being [readily available](http://caniuse.com/namevalue-storage) in [all the browsers AngularJS officially supports](http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq#canidownloadthesourcebuildandhosttheangularjsenvironmentlocally), such fallback is largely redundant.
