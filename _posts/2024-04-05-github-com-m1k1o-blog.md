### Lightweight self-hosted facebook-styled PHP blog.

This is a simple self-hosted, lightweight, singe-user PHP blog, where you can create your own Facebook-like feed. Give read access to other people, and you can share rich text with photos including highlighted code or links.

In this context lightweight means:
* No npm dependency, there won't be an annoying 1GB `node_modules` directory.
* No pipeline. What you see is pure code without a need to install it.
* No overhead, essential features, simple usage.
