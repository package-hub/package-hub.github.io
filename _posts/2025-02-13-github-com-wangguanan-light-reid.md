## [light-reid](https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid)

### [ECCV2020] a toolbox of light-reid learning for faster inference, speed both feature extraction and retrieval stages up to >30x

a toolbox of light reid for fast feature extraction and search 
- [x] light-model: model distillation (3x faster feature extraction)
- [x] light-feature: binary code learning (6x faster retrieval)
- [x] light-search: [coarse2fine search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06826) (2x faster retrieval)

it features
- [x] easy switch between light and non-light reid
- [x] simple modules for reid implementation
- [x] implementations of state-of-the-art deep reid models
