### JavaScript library for realtime, browser-based video and audio editing

Movie Masher is a web-based video editor built entirely in TypeScript and available as a collection of modern ESM packages. It consists of a core library shared by both a React client and ExpressJS server. The client provides an optimized, low resoluition editing experience while the server renders out the result as a high quality video.
