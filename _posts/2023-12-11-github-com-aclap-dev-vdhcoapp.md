### Companion application for Video DownloadHelper browser add-on


*DownloadHelper CoApp* is a multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) application
providing the [Video DownloadHelper](https://downloadhelper.net/)
browser add-on with a set of extra features not available directly
from the add-on:

- file writing API
- launching default video player application on a data file
- a build of the [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) video converter

*DownloadHelper CoApp* complies with the
[native messaging protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging)
and is not intended to be used directly from the command line.
