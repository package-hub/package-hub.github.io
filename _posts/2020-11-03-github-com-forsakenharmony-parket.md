### A library to manage application state, heavily inspired by mobx-state-tree


I was disappointed with all the current state management solutions.
Then I found mobx-state-tree, which seemed like a godsend to me (ok not really, but I liked the concept), but it was pretty big in terms of file size (mobx alone is big: 16.5kB).
So I thought it's surely possible to make a smaller version of it, that's how this started.
And after 2 failed attempts I finally got something that works well
