### Automate Scrubbing your Facebook Presence


I needed a simple and reliable way to delete Facebook posts. There are
third-party apps that claim to do this, but they all require handing over your
credentials, or are unreliable in other ways. Since this uses Selenium, it is
more reliable, as it uses your real web browser, and it is less likely Facebook
will block or throttle you.

As for why you would want to do this in the first place. That is up to you.
Personally I wanted a way to delete most of my content on Facebook without
deleting my account.
