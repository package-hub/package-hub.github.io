## [text-sherlock](https://github.com/cbess/text-sherlock)

### Text (source code) search engine with indexer and a front end web interface to search. Uses Python 3.


Provides a fast, easy to install and simple to use search engine for text, but optimized for source code. An alternative, [OpenGrok](https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok), requires too much time to install (though it may be worth it for some), but is more feature rich. Text Sherlock will give you a much easier setup, a text indexer, and a web app interface for searching with _very little_ effort.
