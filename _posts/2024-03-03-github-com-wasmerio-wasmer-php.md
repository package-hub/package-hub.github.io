### 🐘🕸️ WebAssembly runtime for PHP


* **Easy to use**: The `wasmer` API mimics the standard WebAssembly C API,
* **Fast**: `wasmer` executes the WebAssembly modules as fast as possible, close to **native speed**,
* **Safe**: All calls to WebAssembly will be fast, but more importantly, completely safe and sandboxed.
