### 📦🚀 Fast, zero config application bundler with PHARs.


The Box application simplifies the PHAR building process. Out of the box (no pun intended), the application can do many
great things:

- ⚡  Fast application bundling
- 🔨 [PHAR isolation](doc/code-isolation.md#phar-code-isolation)
- ⚙️ Zero configuration by default
- 🚔 [Requirements checker](doc/requirement-checker.md#requirements-checker)
- 🚨 Friendly error logging experience 
- 🔍 Retrieve information about the PHAR extension or a PHAR file and its contents (`box info` or `box diff`)
- 🔐️ Verify the signature of an existing PHAR (`box verify`)
- 📝 Use Git tags and short commit hashes for versioning
- 🕵️️ Get recommendations and warnings about regarding your configuration (`box validate`)
- 🐳 [Docker support (`box docker`)](doc/docker.md#docker-support)
