### Stream API from Java 8 rewritten on iterators for Java 7 and below


 + Functional interfaces (`Supplier`, `Function`, `Consumer` etc);
 + `Stream`/`IntStream`/`LongStream`/`DoubleStream` (without parallel processing, but with a variety of additional methods and with custom operators);
 + `Optional`/`OptionalBoolean`/`OptionalInt`/`OptionalLong`/`OptionalDouble` classes;
 + `Exceptional` class - functional way to deal with exceptions;
 + `Objects` from Java 7.
