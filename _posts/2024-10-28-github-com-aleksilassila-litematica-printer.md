## [litematica-printer](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer)

### An extension for Litematica that adds the missing printer functionality for 1.19, 1.18 and 1.17


This fork adds printing functionality for Litematica fabric 1.16 version.
Printer allows players to build big structures more quickly by automatically placing the correct blocks.

Because the main branch is dedicated for 1.12 LiteLoader, my code can be found in [printer](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printing/tree/printing) branch. If you have issues with the printer, 
**do not** bother the original creator of Litematica (maruohon) with them. Contact me instead.

For downloads check out [releases](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printing/releases/latest).
