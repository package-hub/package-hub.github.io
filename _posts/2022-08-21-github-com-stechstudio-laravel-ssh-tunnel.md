### Easy creation & maintenance of an SSH Tunnel for Laravel/Lumen

Access a service on a remote host, via an SSH Tunnel! For example, people have been asking how to connect to a MySQL server over SSH in PHP for years.

 - [Connect to a MySQL server over SSH in PHP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/464317/connect-to-a-mysql-server-over-ssh-in-php)
 - [Connect to a MySQL server over SSH in PHP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309615/connect-to-a-mysql-server-over-ssh-in-php)
 - [Connect to a mysql database via SSH through PHP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18069658/connect-to-a-mysql-database-via-ssh-through-php)
 - [Connect to remote MySQL database with PHP using SSH](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4927056/connect-to-remote-mysql-database-with-php-using-ssh)
 - [Laravel MySql DB Connection with SSH](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25495364/laravel-mysql-db-connection-with-ssh)

We had a similar challenge, specifically accessing a MySQL database over an SSH Tunnel and all of the Questions and Answers were helpful in finding a solution. However, we wanted something that would just plug and play with our Laravel applications and Lumen Services.

So we wrote this package. We hope you enjoy it!
