### Display arbitrary GeoJSON on a map with a timeline slider and play button


Show any changing geospatial data over time, from points to polygons.

If you want smooth motion of markers from point to point, this is not your

[Leaflet Realtime][], both plugins from which I may or may not have pilfered
some ideas.
