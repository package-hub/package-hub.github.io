### Tools for developing Nostr clients.


Tools for developing [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) clients.

Only depends on _@scure_ and _@noble_ packages.

This package is only providing lower-level functionality. If you want more higher-level features, take a look at [Nostrify](https://nostrify.dev), or if you want an easy-to-use fully-fledged solution that abstracts the hard parts of Nostr and makes decisions on your behalf, take a look at [NDK](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk) and [@snort/system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snort/system).
