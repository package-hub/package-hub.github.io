### Python3 library providing an easy interface to the Bitcoin data structures and protocol.


This Python3 library provides an easy interface to the bitcoin data
structures and protocol. The approach is low-level and "ground up", with a
focus on providing tools to manipulate the internals of how Bitcoin works.

"The Swiss Army Knife of the Bitcoin protocol." - Wladimir J. van der Laan
