## [Slide](https://github.com/Haptic-Apps/Slide)

### Slide is an open-source, ad-free Reddit browser for Android.


This project will be on indefinite hiatus for the foreseeable future, and may not be maintained.
Updates are not guaranteed.
See [here](https://github.com/Haptic-Apps/Slide/issues/3449) for details.

You may continue to use Slide if you so wish.
However, with this said, it would be recommended to consider migrating to another (more stable) Reddit client.

Some other open-source (and internally ad-free) Reddit clients include:
- [Infinity For Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit)
- [RedReader](https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader)
- [Dawn](https://github.com/Tunous/Dawn)
