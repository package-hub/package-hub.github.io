### Machine Learning Platform and Recommendation Engine built on Kubernetes


 * [Seldon Core open sourced](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core). 
    * Seldon Core focuses purely on deploying a wide range of ML models on Kubernetes, allowing complex runtime serving graphs to be managed in production. Seldon Core is a progression of the goals of the Seldon-Server project but also a more restricted focus to solving the final step in a machine learning project which is serving models in production. Please have a look at the [project page](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) which includes extensive documentation to investigate further.
