### Text / code editor typing latency analyzer


Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.

Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.

Check my article [Typing with pleasure](https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure) to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.
