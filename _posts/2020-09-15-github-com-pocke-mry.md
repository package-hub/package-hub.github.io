### Mry Migrates .Rubocop.Yml


Mry Migrates .Rubocop.Yml :muscle:


RuboCop has many many breaking changes, because it is before version 1.0.
So, if you update your RuboCop version, .rubocop.yml breaks in many cases...
This tool supports migrating `.rubocop.yml`. It automatically renames the configuration in your `.rubocop.yml` that was renamed by the updated RuboCop version. So, with this tool, you do not have to be afraid of updating RuboCop anymore!
