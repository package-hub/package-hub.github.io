### ✔️ Hide a secret message in an image

Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone  cannot know the presence or contents of the hidden message. Although related, Steganography is not to be confused with Encryption, which is the process of making a message unintelligible—Steganography attempts to hide the existence of communication.
The main advantage of steganography algorithm is because of its simple security mechanism. Because the steganographic message is integrated invisibly and covered inside other harmless sources, it is very difficult to detect the message without knowing
the existence and the appropriate encoding scheme .
