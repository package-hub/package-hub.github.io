### A library for building dApps on the Tezos Blockchain - JavaScript / TypeScript


Taquito is a fast and lightweight [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) library to accelerate DApp development on the [Tezos](https://tezos.com/developers) blockchain. With it, you can easily interact with Smart Contracts deployed to Tezos. It is distributed as a suite of individual `npm` packages, to reduce bloat and improve application startup times.
