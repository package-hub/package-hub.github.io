### phpLDAPadmin - Web based LDAP administration tool

phpLDAPadmin is a web based LDAP data management tool for system administrators. It is commonly known and referred by many as "PLA".

PLA is designed to be compliant with LDAP RFCs, enabling it to be used with any LDAP server.
If you come across an LDAP server, where PLA exhibits problems, please open an issue with full details of the problem so that we can have it fixed.

For up to date information on PLA, please head to the [wiki](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/wiki).

> **NOTE**: GIT **master** is currently in active development, and as such functionality may be missing, broken or not working as expected.
>
> If you are after a working version of PLA, please use one of the tagged releases.
