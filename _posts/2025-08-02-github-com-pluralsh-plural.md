### Enterprise Kubernetes management, accelerated. ðŸš€


Plural will deploy open-source applications and proprietary services on Kubernetes in your cloud using common standards like Helm and Terraform.

The Plural platform provides the following:

* Fleet-Scale GitOps Engine to deploy any helm/kustomize or yaml based service into your fleet, securely and seamlessly scalable.
* Full visibility of your fleet and all deployed services via our secure Auth Proxy.
* Kubernetes CRD-native Infrastructure As Code Management, supporting Terraform, Ansible and Pulumi, to allow you to scale usage of best practices tools without labor intensive CI/CD and branching strategies.  Get the scaling promise of Crossplane with the configuration language of terraform.
* Automated Pull Request Generation to provide full ui-based self-service while still maintaining the rigor and auditability of GitOps
* 360 Degree AI Integration, leveraging the fully integrated, all-in-one Plural platform to generate uniquely accurate AI insights into the state of your fleet and how to fix inevitable misconfigurations that might have arisen. 

In addition, the Plural api also provides:
* A DNS service to register fully-qualified domains under onplural.sh to eliminate the hassle of DNS registration for users.
* Being an OIDC provider to enable zero touch login security for all deployed Plural Console applications or any other application managed by it.
