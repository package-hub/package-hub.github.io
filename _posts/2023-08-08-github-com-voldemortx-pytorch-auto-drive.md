### PytorchAutoDrive: Segmentation models (ERFNet, ENet, DeepLab, FCN...) and Lane detection models (SCNN, RESA, LSTR, LaneATT, BÃ©zierLaneNet...) based on PyTorch with fast training, visualization, benchmarking & deployment help



*PytorchAutoDrive* is a **pure Python** framework includes semantic segmentation models, lane detection models based on **PyTorch**. Here we provide full stack supports from research (model training, testing, fair benchmarking by simply writing configs) to application (visualization, model deployment).

**Paper:** [Rethinking Efficient Lane Detection via Curve Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02431) (CVPR 2022)

*This repository is under active development, results with models uploaded are stable. For legacy code users, please check [deprecations](https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive/issues/14) for changes.*
