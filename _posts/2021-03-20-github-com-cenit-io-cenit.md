### :rocket: Cenit IO - 100% open source integration Platform (iPaaS)


Is a 100% open integration Platform (iPaaS) that's modern, powerful, yet hackable to the core, ready to use in the cloud https://cenit.io or on-premises. It is designed to solve unique integrations needs, orchestrate data flows that may involve types of protocols and data formats, and provide API management capabilities. All of which can support a wide range of integration use cases. It is particular valuable to embrace a pervasive integration approach.

To install and learn more about the platform check the [documentation](https://cenit-io.github.io/docs)
