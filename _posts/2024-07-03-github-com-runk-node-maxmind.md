### Maxmind GEO Lookup 


Javascript module for Geo IP lookup using Maxmind binary databases (aka mmdb or geoip2).
Fastest Maxmind lookup library available - up to [17,000% faster](https://github.com/runk/node-maxmind-benchmark) than other libraries. Module has 100% test coverage with comprehensive test suite. It natively works with binary Maxmind database format and doesn't require any "CSV - {specific lib format}" conversions as some other modules do. Maxmind binary databases are highly optimized for size and performance so there's no point using other formats.
