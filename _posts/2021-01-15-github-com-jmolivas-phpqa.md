### PHPQA all-in-one Analyzer CLI tool

This project aims to serve as a CLI tool to make easy the use of different PHP tools related to Quality Assurance and code analysis in PHP.

Every analyzer tool handles arguments and options using different formats, the goal of this project is to provide a single way to interact with those projects, you can also set options and arguments using a default configuration file when the project supports it.

> This project was originally developed as part of [Drupal Console](https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole) and based on the blog post [Write your git hooks in PHP and keep them under git control](http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/write-your-git-hooks-in-php-and-keep-them-under-git-control/).
