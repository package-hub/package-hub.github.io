### UVdesk Opensource Community Helpdesk Project built for all to make a Full Ticketing Support System along with many more other features.


In this step of the installation process, you'll be downloading the helpdesk project skeleton and installing all of its dependent components.

As per your convenience, you can choose to either use composer for download the project and install all its dependencies automatically or directly download the project archive that comes pre-packaged with all of the project dependencies already installed.

We recommend using composer over direct download whenever possible. However, if your system does not have enough ram to execute composer operations properly (for example: installing on a shared host with limited system resources), we suggest using the direct download method instead to mitigate these kind of issues.

Irrespective of the method you use, the process to configuring your helpdesk remains the same.
