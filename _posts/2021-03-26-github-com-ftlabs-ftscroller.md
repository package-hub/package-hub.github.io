## [ftscroller](https://github.com/ftlabs/ftscroller)

### FTScroller is a cross-browser Javascript/CSS library to allow touch, mouse or scrollwheel scrolling within specified elements, with pagination, snapping and bouncing support.


FTScroller is a library for adding momentum scrolling to web content on devices with a touch interface, compatible across most modern platforms including desktop browsers.  Although recently support for `overflow: scroll` (or touch equivalents) has increased, this is often still not implemented in a cross-platform or backwards-compatible way, and with no support for features like snapping.

FTScroller is developed by [FT Labs](http://labs.ft.com), part of the Financial Times.  It is inspired by [Touchscroll](https://github.com/davidaurelio/TouchScroll) and [Zynga Scroller](https://github.com/zynga/scroller), but is a complete rewrite.  It is extensively used in the [FT Web App](http://app.ft.com), and was developed to achieve better performance and compatibility, including mouse and touch input.
