## [rssbox](https://github.com/stefansundin/rssbox)

### :newspaper: I consume the world via RSS feeds, and this is my attempt to keep it that way.


This app uses the API of other websites and gives you an RSS feed in return. Quick and simple.

To open `vlc://` links, see [vlc-protocol](https://github.com/stefansundin/vlc-protocol).

You can use this app freely at [rssbox.herokuapp.com](https://rssbox.herokuapp.com/). An experimental Elastic Beanstalk version [is available](https://rssbox.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
