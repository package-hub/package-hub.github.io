### Tool to gather Threat Intelligence indicators from publicly available sources


Installation on Unix and Unix-like systems is straightforward. Either clone the repository or download the [latest release](https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine/releases). You will need pip and the python development libraries. In Ubuntu, the following commands will get you prepared:

```
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv git
git clone https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine.git
cd combine
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you should be ready to run Combine.

We also have a [dockerfile](https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine/tree/master/docker) available.
