### â›´ Make Next.js and react-navigation play nicely together with an Expo/React Native Web app.


Exciting news: the future of this library will be [solito](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito). I completely changed the API and approach into something much more scalable and simple, so I decided to make a new library altogether.

This change is a result of my thinking on [#68](https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-next-react-navigation/issues) about the future API.

If you're already using `expo-next-react-navigation`, don't stress. You can continue to use it as you please. But I recommend using solito, even if you're incrementally adopting it. 

I have *tons* of code using `expo-next-react-navigation` in my own app, and I won't be able to change it overnight. But going forward, all new navigation code I write will use solito instead.

While this repo will of course stay up, I will probably no longer make updates to `expo-next-react-navigation`.
