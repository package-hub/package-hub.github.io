### Write to Laravel Config files and maintain file integrity


Write to Laravel Config files and maintain file integrity.

This library is an extension of the Config component used by Laravel. It adds the ability to write to configuration files.

The following value types are supported for writing: strings, integers, booleans and single-dimension arrays.
