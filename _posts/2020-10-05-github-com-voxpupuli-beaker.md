### Puppet Acceptance Testing Harness


Beaker is a test harness focused on acceptance testing via interactions between multiple (virtual) machines. It provides platform abstraction between different Systems Under Test (SUTs), and it can also be used as a virtual machine provisioner - setting up machines, running any commands on those machines, and then exiting.

Beaker runs tests written in Ruby, and provides additional Domain-Specific Language (DSL) methods.  This gives you access to all standard Ruby along with acceptance testing specific commands.
