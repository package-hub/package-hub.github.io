### Reanimated 2 powered gallery implementation


Use npm or yarn to install the library

```bash
npm i --save react-native-gallery-toolkit
```

> Also, you need to install [react-native-reanimated@2.0.0-alpha.7](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) (the new 2 version) and [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler), and follow their installation instructions.

Expo is not currently supported because this library uses the latest version of Reanimated 2 (expo supports right now only alpha.6.1).
