* **🚀 Out-of-the-Box Embedding Model**
To help you get started faster, we now include a default local embedding model (`bge-micro-v2`). No more manual setup is required to use powerful semantic features!

* **🗂️ Workspaces**
Organize your projects, research, and personal notes with the new **Workspaces** feature. Keep your context clean and switch between different setups seamlessly.

* **💡 Insights**
Go beyond simple notes with our new **Insights** feature. Synthesize information, discover connections, and gain a deeper understanding of your knowledge base.

* **🔍 Advanced Multi-Dimensional Queries**
Converse with your notes! You can now perform complex queries based on various dimensions like time, tasks, and other metadata. Finding the exact piece of information has never been easier.

* **✍️ New "Write" Mode**
We've rebuilt our **Write** mode from the ground up to provide a more intuitive, powerful, and distraction-free writing experience.
