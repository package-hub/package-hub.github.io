### A light, fast, flexible Javascript IOC container


Wire is an [Inversion of Control Container](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html "Inversion of Control Containers and the
Dependency Injection pattern")
for Javascript apps, and acts as the Application Composition layer for
[cujoJS](http://cujojs.com).

Wire provides architectural plumbing that allows you to create and manage
application components, and to connect those components together in loosely
coupled and non-invasive ways.  Consequently, your components will be more
modular, easier to unit test and refactor, and your application will be
easier to evolve and maintain.

and check out a few [example applications](docs/introduction.md#example-apps).
