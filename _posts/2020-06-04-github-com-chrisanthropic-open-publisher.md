## [Open-Publisher](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/Open-Publisher)

### Using Jekyll to create outputs that can be used as Pandoc inputs. In short - input markdown, output mobi, epub, pdf, and print-ready pdf. With a focus on fiction.

Open publisher is really just a couple of bash scripts that wrap around Jekyll, Pandoc, KindleGen, and LaTeX, along with some custom Pandoc templates created with a focus on fiction.

Write your manuscript in markdown, run a script, and receive some beautifully formatted ePub, Mobi, and print-ready PDF books.
