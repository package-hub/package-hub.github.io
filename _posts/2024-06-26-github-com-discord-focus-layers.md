### Tiny React hooks for isolating focus within subsections of the DOM.


Tiny React hooks for isolating focus within subsections of the DOM. Useful for supporting accessible
`dialog` widgets like modals, popouts, and alerts.

No wrapper components, no emulation, no pre-defined "list of tabbable elements", and no data
attributes. Implemented entirely with native APIs and events, with no additional dependencies.
