Original version by Adam Laurie, but significant changes by John
McMaster, Caitlin Morgan, and Jessy Exum.


Rompar is an interactive tool for extracting bianry data out of mask
ROM images. The computer vision method implemented is rather simple,
but has proven useful in several projects. There is still a lot that
can be added to rompar, and pull requests are welcome.
