## [Everest](https://github.com/RohitAwate/Everest)

### A beautiful, cross-platform REST client.

- Everest is written in Java. Thus, it is significantly **lighter on resources and more responsive** than its Electron-based alternatives like _Postman_. It aims to provide the same level of functionality in a lighter, native but equally slick package.
- Aesthetic is very important. With a **gorgeous, flat design**, Everest is a pleasure to look at and to work with. It is also entirely theme-_able_.

  > I want you to want to use it!

- Being a Java application, Everest is inherently **cross-platform**. It will run anywhere there's a JVM.
- Everest will offer cloud synchronization of your projects powered by [Summit](https://github.com/RohitAwate/Summit). It will be available as a cloud service early next year or you may also choose to self-host it.
