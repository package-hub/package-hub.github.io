## [redux-remotedev](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-remotedev)

### Redux DevTools for production (web and React Native) with a highly flexible API.

Receive logs/reports from production and get them replicated with [Redux DevTools extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) (or other [monitoring apps](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools#monitoring)). Unlike other solutions (like [Remote Redux DevTools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools)), it aims to be optimized for production and suitable for different use cases (see [the options](#api)). Even though it's designed to be used together with [`remotedev-server`](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev-server), it can be easily integrated with any other server or serverless architectures.
