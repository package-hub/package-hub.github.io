### Ruby Tricks, Idiomatic Ruby, Refactoring and Best Practices


> Do you know why experienced Ruby programmers tend to reach for basic collections
> and hashes while programmers from other languages go for more specialized classes?
> Do you know the difference between strip, chop, and chomp; and why there are three
> such similar methods when apparently one might suffice (Not to mention lstrip and
> rstrip!)? Do you know the downsides of dynamic typing? Do you know why the differences
> between strings and symbols get so blurry, even to experienced Ruby developers?
> How about metaprogramming? What the heck is an eigenclass? How about
> protected methods? Do you know what theyâ€™re really about? Really? Are you sure?

This repository aims to help everyone write more idiomatic, clean, and tricky ruby code and also document good refactoring techniques. You can add your own technique or paste it from some website. Do not forget the source, of course. All the tricks are in the /tricks folder.

For the sake of clarity, you should paste in the markdown format. At the end, if the code is not your own, paste a reference to the author and source of the technique.
