⚠️ **Important:** This library it is not compatible with the new version of embed lib - [version 1](https://github.com/Typeform/embed). These docs are for old embed library. Please use the new version here: https://github.com/Typeform/embed

**Typeform/embed** is the client-side script and a [CommonJS module](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) that allows you to integrate a typeform into your website easily.

This README file contains instructions to embed typeform into your website. If you are looking to set up the project locally for development and contribution, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are not comfortable with frontend development you can [embed typeform via code snippets](https://www.typeform.com/help/embed-a-typeform/)
