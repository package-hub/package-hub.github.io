## [ct-js](https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js)

### Ct.js is a desktop game engine that makes learning programming fun and game development easy by its visual editors and well-documented code library


Ct.js is a project maintained by CoMiGo, and programmed mainly by them as well, with little support from [dear contributors](https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js/graphs/contributors) and translators. And *it sucks!* Ct.js is a good game editor, but can be the best one, and one developer is not enough to transition it from a dream to a reality.

If you are willing to participate in ct.js' future, contact me at Discord (CoMiGo#7821) or Telegram (@CoMiGo). Or jump straightly to the [main dev board](https://github.com/orgs/ct-js/projects/1) for current issues.
