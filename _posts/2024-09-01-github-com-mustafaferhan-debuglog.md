## [DebugLog](https://github.com/MustafaFerhan/DebugLog)

### Create a simple and more understandable Android logs. 


android.util.Log is the most usable library of the Android. But, when the app released on the market, some important information is clearly forgotten by the developer. 
All logs are disabled by DebugLog when the app is released.  

And plus, it provides more understandable DDMS logs for developers.
