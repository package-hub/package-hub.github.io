### A minimalist solution for building micro front-end applications. 一种用于构建微前端应用的极简方案

micro-app is a micro front-end framework launched by JD Retail. It renders based on webcomponent-like and realizes the micro front-end from component thinking, it aiming to reduce the difficulty of getting started and improve work efficiency. 

It is the lowest cost framework for accessing micro front-end, and provides a series of perfect functions such as JS sandbox, style isolation, element isolation, preloading, resource address completion, plugin system, data communication and so on.

The micro-app has nothing to do with the technology stack, nor is it tied to the business, and can be used in any front-end framework.
