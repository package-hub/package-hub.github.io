### Yoyo is a full-stack PHP framework to create rich, dynamic interfaces using server-rendered HTML. You keep on writing PHP and let Yoyo make your creations come alive.


Yoyo is a full-stack PHP framework that you can use on any project to create rich dynamic interfaces using server-rendered HTML.

With Yoyo, you create reactive components that are seamlessly updated without the need to write any Javascript code.

Yoyo ships with a simple templating system, and  offers out-of-the-box support for [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade), without having to use Laravel, and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).

Inspired by [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and [Sprig](https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig), and using [htmx](https://htmx.org/).
