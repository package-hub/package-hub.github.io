### Feature-filled Bittorrent client based on the Azureus open source project


Source for BiglyBT, a feature filled, open source, ad-free, bittorrent client.  BiglyBT is forked from the original project and is being maintained by two of the original developers as well as members of the community.  With over 15 years of development, there's a good chance we have the features you are looking for, as well as the decade old bugs you aren't looking for :)
