### Gamified Chaos Engineering Tool for Kubernetes


**Gamified Chaos Engineering Tool for K8s**

This project is part of landscape of [Cloud Native Computing Foudation](https://landscape.cncf.io/) in the Observability and Analysis - Chaos Engineering section.

- Launch the demo at this link [https://kubeinvaders.platformengineering.it](https://kubeinvaders.platformengineering.it/)
- Monitor the pod status here [https://kubeopsview.platformengineering.it](https://kubeopsview.platformengineering.it)

Backed by the teams at [platformengineering.it](https://platformengineering.it) and [devopstribe.it](https://devopstribe.it), which provides enterprise-grade features and certified resilience services for your Kubernetes infrastructure.

[Here are the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/EugenioMarzo/kubeinvaders-chaos-engineering-practices-for-kubernetes1pdf) from the Chaos Engineering speech I prepared for FOSDEM 2023. Unfortunately, I could not be present at my talk, but I would still like to share them with the community.
