### A Markdown editor in browser with collaborative editing


[web-editor-markdown](https://github.com/Ben-love-zy/web-editor-markdown.git) is a Markdown editor in Web browser and for real-time rendering like `Typora`. It is based on TypeScript and JavaScript, and does not rely on any third-party framework. It supports Chinese friendly and can be easily extended and connected to native JavaScript, Vue, React, Angular and other applications. It provides four rendering modes: `SOURCE`, `SOURCE_AND_PREVIEW`, `RENDER` and `PREVIEW`. If necessary, its underlying layer also supports the ability of collaborative editing and provides atomic `Operation` for extending collaborative editing.
