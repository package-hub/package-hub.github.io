## [apollo-link-rest](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest)

### Use existing REST endpoints with GraphQL


> The [Apollo Link Rest](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest) library is maintained by Apollo community members and not an Apollo GraphQL maintained library. For information on progress check out [the issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest/issues) or [the design](./designs/initial.md). We would love your help with writing docs, testing, anything! We would love for you, yes you, to be a part of the Apollo community!
