### Browser extension that strips Google Analytics (UTM) parameters, and various other click tracking tokens, from URL query strings


This is a Chrome and Firefox browser extension that strips Google Analytics
(i.e. [Urchin Tracking Monitor][utm]) parameters, and various other click
tracking tokens, from URL query strings. This is done *before* the web request
is made and results in both more private browsing as well as more aesthetically
pleasing URLs.

You can install this extensions from the [Chrome Web Store][chrome-webstore],
[Firefox Add-ons][firefox-addons], or [Edge Add-ons][edge-addons].
