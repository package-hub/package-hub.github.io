### Meta search for NZB indexers

* I don't have anything to do with www.nzbhydra.com
* While this version still runs fine I recommend using its successor [NZBHydra2](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2) which runs a lot faster and has more features. Therefore I have removed all instructions regarding usage or development.
