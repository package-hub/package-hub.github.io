### Data manipulation and transformation for audio signal processing, powered by PyTorch


`torchaudio` has binary distributions for PyPI (`pip`) and Anaconda (`conda`).

Starting `0.10`, torchaudio has CPU-only and CUDA-enabled binary distributions, each of which requires a matching PyTorch version.

Please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the details.
