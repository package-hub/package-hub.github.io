### Google Keep app inspired time picker for react :clock4:


```shell
$ yarn add react-timekeeper

# or via npm
$ npm install --save react-timekeeper
```

Version 2+ of timekeeper requires [react hooks (v16.8)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html). If you're using an older version of react, install timekeeper v1 via
```shell
$ npm install --save react-timekeeper@^1.0.0
```
