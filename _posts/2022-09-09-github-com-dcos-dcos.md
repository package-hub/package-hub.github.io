> ## DC/OS End of Life

> Support for DC/OS ends on October 31, 2021. We will continue to provide support for our current DC/OS customers per their contracts, of course. However, we will no longer be investing in new features or capabilities or maintaining the related repositories. If a customer wishes to continue use of the DC/OS Enterprise platform or other non-free DC/OS components, the customer can purchase an End-of-Life License or Perpetual Use License, however support is not included in these licenses and continued use of DC/OS will be at your own discretion and risk.

> We want to thank all of our loyal customers, particularly those DC/OS users who were fellow pioneers in the growth of the cloud native landscape from the beginning.
