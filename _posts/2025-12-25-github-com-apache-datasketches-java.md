## [datasketches-java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java)

### A software library of stochastic streaming algorithms, a.k.a. sketches.

This is the core Java component of the DataSketches library.  It contains all of the sketching algorithms and can be accessed directly from user applications. 

This component is also a dependency of other components of the library that create adaptors for target systems, such as the [Apache Pig adaptor](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-pig) and the [Apache Hive adaptor](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-hive).

Note that we have a parallel core components for [C++](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp) and [Python](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-python) implementations of the same sketch algorithms.

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information.
