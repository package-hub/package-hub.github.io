### Spotify authentication strategy for Passport and Node.js.


[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/)
using the OAuth 2.0 API.

This module lets you authenticate using Spotify in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, Spotify authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

For more information about Spotify's OAuth 2.0 implementation, check their
[Web API Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).
