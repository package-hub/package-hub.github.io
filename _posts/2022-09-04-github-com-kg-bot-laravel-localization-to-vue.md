## [laravel-localization-to-vue](https://github.com/kg-bot/laravel-localization-to-vue)

### Make Laravel standard localization files available in format required by various JavaSript localization packages


This package collects all localizations from resources/lang directory and it's sub-directories and converts them to plain array  
which can later be converted to JSON object and used with libraries like Vue, Angular, etc.
