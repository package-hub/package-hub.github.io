## [laravel-microscope](https://github.com/imanghafoori1/laravel-microscope)

### Fearless refactoring, it does a lot of smart checks to find certain errors.


- It is created to be **smarter than phpstorm** and other IDEs in finding errors.
- It is created to **understand laravel run-time** and magic.
- It does **not show you stupid false errors**, all the reported cases are really errors.
- Even If you have written a lot of tests for your app, **you may still need this**.
- **It can refactor your code**, by applying `early returns` automatically.
- It is written from scratch to yield the **maximum performance** possible.
