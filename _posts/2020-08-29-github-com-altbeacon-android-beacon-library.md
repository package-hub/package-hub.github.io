### Allows Android apps to interact with BLE beacons


It allows Android devices to use beacons much like iOS devices do.  An app can request to get notifications when one
or more beacons appear or disappear.  An app can also request to get a ranging update from one or more beacons
at a frequency of approximately 1Hz.
