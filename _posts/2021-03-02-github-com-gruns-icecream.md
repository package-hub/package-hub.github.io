### üç¶ Never use print() to debug again.


Do you ever use `print()` or `log()` to debug your code? Of course you
do. IceCream, or `ic` for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.

IceCream is well tested, [permissively licensed](LICENSE.txt), and supports
Python 2, Python 3, PyPy2, and PyPy3.
