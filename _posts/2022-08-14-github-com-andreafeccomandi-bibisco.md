### Novel writing software


bibisco is an open source application for **writing novels**.

bibisco is a personal project, made with love. 

We love books and we want to help writers to write beautiful novels.

With bibisco you can organize chapters and scenes, manage revisions, export novel in pdf, docx, or txt and write with a fully featured text editor.

You can create a novel structure, define premise, fabula, narrative strands and settings: geographic, temporal and social context.

And, most of all, with bibisco you can **know everything about your characters**. Because your novel works only if its characters are believable, that is when you understand their human nature's complexity.

bibisco has 2 versions: **Community Edition** and **Supporters Edition**; this is the repository of **bibisco Community Edition**.
