### Your performance & security consultant, an artisan command away.


Think of Enlightn as your performance and security consultant. Enlightn will "review" your code and server configurations, and give you actionable recommendations on improving performance, security and reliability!

The Enlightn OSS (open source software) version has 64 automated checks that scan your application code, web server configurations and routes to identify performance bottlenecks, possible security vulnerabilities and code reliability issues.

Enlightn Pro (commercial) is available for purchase on the [Enlightn website](https://www.laravel-enlightn.com/) and has an additional 64 automated checks (total of **128 checks**).
