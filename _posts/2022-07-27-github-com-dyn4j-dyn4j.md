### Java Collision Detection and Physics Engine


A 100% Java 2D collision detection and physics engine.  Designed to be fast, stable, extensible, and easy to use.  dyn4j is free for use in commercial and non-commercial applications.

The project is comprised of the main project and tests managed here and two others:
- [dyn4j-samples](https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j-samples) A collection of samples to help get started
- [dyn4j-sandbox](https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j-sandbox) A non-trivial desktop application that allows users to build scenes, run, save, and load them - all built with dyn4j as the simulation engine.
