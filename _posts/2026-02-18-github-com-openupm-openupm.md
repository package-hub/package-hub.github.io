### OpenUPM - Open Source Unity Package Registry (UPM)


OpenUPM is an open-source service for hosting and building open-source Unity Package Manager (UPM) packages. The intention is to create a universal platform to discover, distribute, and share open-source UPM packages, and build a community along with it.

OpenUPM is composed of two parts:
- The managed [scoped package registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html) for hosting UPM packages.
- The automatic build pipelines for tracking, building, and publishing UPM packages based on Git tags.

> DISCLAIMER: OpenUPM is an open-source service, not an official service provided by Unity Technologies Inc.
