### A render management system you can deploy for visual effects and animation productions.


OpenCue is an open source render management system. You can use OpenCue in
visual effects and animation production to break down complex jobs into
individual tasks. You can submit jobs to a configurable dispatch queue that
allocates the necessary computational resources.
