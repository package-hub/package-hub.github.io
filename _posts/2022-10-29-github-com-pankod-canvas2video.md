### canvas2video is a backend solution for creating and rendering dynamic videos.


@pankod/canvas2video is a backend solution for creating and rendering dynamic videos. It lets you build web canvas scenes by using the *Cairo-backed* [fabric](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) library and add animations with [gsap](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP).
Your animation timeline will be rendered frame by frame and piped to ffmpeg renderer for the final video output.
