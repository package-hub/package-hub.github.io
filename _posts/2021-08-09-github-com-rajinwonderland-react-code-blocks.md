### React code blocks and code snippet components


Initially, this started as a small project looking to modify [Atlaskit's]() Code Block component to support more languages (i.e `graphql`, `reasonml`, etc). It then rapidly evolved into a **never-ending rabbithole** which ended up with support for themes (i.e railscast, darcula, monokai, etc), customizable styles, and copy functionality too!

I don't plan on keeping this updated unless people are looking to actually use it. So don't be shy! Feel free to post an [issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or a [pr](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
