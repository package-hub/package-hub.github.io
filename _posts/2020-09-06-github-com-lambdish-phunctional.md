### ⚡️ λ PHP functional library focused on simplicity and performance


Phunctional is heavily inspired by [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and some other PHP libraries like [iter](https://github.com/nikic/iter), [compose](https://github.com/igorw/compose) and [felpado](https://github.com/pablodip/felpado).

The main principles that we have in mind developing this library are:
 * A collection can be any iterable PHP object, arrays or generators
 * Favor composition vs inheritance
 * Be lazy when you can
 * Avoid state, state is (usually) evil!
 * Simplicity over easiness
 * Break the above rules if it makes sense

All of this can be resumed with a word: __Immutability__.
