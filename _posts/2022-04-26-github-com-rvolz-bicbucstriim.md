BicBucStriim streams books, digital books. It was primarily designed to fill a gap in the functionality of NAS devices that provide access to music, videos and photos -- but not books. BicBucStriim fills this gap and provides web-based access to your e-book collection.

BicBucStriim is a simple PHP application that runs in a PHP environment provided by the NAS. It assumes that you manage your e-book collection with [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/). The application reads the Calibre data and publishes it in HTML form. To access the e-book catalog you simply point your ebook reader to your NAS, select one of your e-books and download it.
