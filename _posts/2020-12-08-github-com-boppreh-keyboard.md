## [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)

### Hook and simulate global keyboard events on Windows and Linux.


- **Global event hook** on all keyboards (captures keys regardless of focus).
- **Listen** and **send** keyboard events.
- Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo), with experimental **OS X** support (thanks @glitchassassin!).
- **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.
- **Zero dependencies**. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the files.
- **Python 2 and 3**.
- Complex hotkey support (e.g. `ctrl+shift+m, ctrl+space`) with controllable timeout.
- Includes **high level API** (e.g. [record](#keyboard.record) and [play](#keyboard.play), [add_abbreviation](#keyboard.add_abbreviation)).
- Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with **full internationalization support** (e.g. `Ctrl+ç`).
- Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.
- Tested and documented.
- Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook).
- Mouse support available via project [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) (`pip install mouse`).
