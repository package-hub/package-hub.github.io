### Z-Wave driver written entirely in JavaScript/TypeScript


Z-Wave is an amazing piece of technology, but it is difficult to get started with and develop for.  
**It shouldn't be!** We've got you covered.

Built on Node.js and compatible with all known 500 and 700 series Z-Wave controller hardware adapters, **Z-Wave JS** runs on almost anything with a little bit of computing power and a serial port. Check out the [documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js) to get started!
