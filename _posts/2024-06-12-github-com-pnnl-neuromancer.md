### Pytorch-based framework for solving parametric constrained optimization problems, physics-informed system identification, and parametric model predictive control. 


**Neural Modules with Adaptive Nonlinear Constraints and Efficient Regularizations (NeuroMANCER)**
is an open-source differentiable programming (DP) library for solving parametric constrained optimization problems, 
physics-informed system identification, and parametric model-based optimal control.
NeuroMANCER is written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and allows for systematic 
integration of machine learning with scientific computing for creating end-to-end 
differentiable models and algorithms embedded with prior knowledge and physics.
