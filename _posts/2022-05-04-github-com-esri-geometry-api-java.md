### The Esri Geometry API for Java enables developers to write custom applications for analysis of spatial data.  This API is used in the Esri GIS Tools for Hadoop and other 3rd-party data processing solutions.


The Esri Geometry API for Java can be used to enable spatial data processing in 3rd-party data-processing solutions.  Developers of custom MapReduce-based applications for Hadoop can use this API for spatial processing of data in the Hadoop system.  The API is also used by the [Hive UDF’s](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop) and could be used by developers building geometry functions for 3rd-party applications such as [Cassandra]( https://cassandra.apache.org/), [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/), [Storm](http://storm-project.net/) and many other Java-based “big data” applications.
