## [react-native-fbsdk](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk)

### A React Native wrapper around the Facebook SDKs for Android and iOS.  Provides access to Facebook login, sharing, graph requests, app events etc.


React Native FBSDK is a wrapper around the iOS Facebook SDK and Android Facebook SDK, allowing for Facebook integration in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps. Access to native components, from login to sharing, is provided entirely through documented JavaScript modules so you don't have to call a single native function directly.

Functionality is provided through one single npm package so you can use it for both platforms without downloading any extra packages. Follow this guide to use react-native-fbsdk in your React Native app. You can also visit https://developers.facebook.com/docs/react-native for tutorials and reference documentation.
