## [librato-metrics](https://github.com/librato/librato-metrics)

### Ruby wrapper to make it easy to interact with Librato's API.


**NOTE:** Starting with version 2.1.0 librato-metrics requires a Librato account that [supports tagged metrics](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/faq/account_questions/tags_or_sources/). If your Librato account doesn't yet support tagged metrics please use the [1.6.1 version](https://rubygems.org/gems/librato-metrics/versions/1.6.1).

---

This gem provides granular control for scripting interactions with the Metrics core API. It is well suited for integrations, scripts, workers & background jobs. If you want to submit from a web app, take at look at [librato-rails](https://github.com/librato/librato-rails) and/or [librato-rack](https://github.com/librato/librato-rack).
