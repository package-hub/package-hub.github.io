### A z-address first full node and UI wallet for zcash


**Note**: Zecwallet Fullnode will download the **entire blockchain (about 26GB)**, and requires some familiarity with the command line. If you don't want to download the blockchain but prefer a Lite wallet, please check out [Zecwallet Lite](https://www.zecwallet.co).

Head over to the releases page and grab the latest installers or binary. https://www.zecwallet.co
