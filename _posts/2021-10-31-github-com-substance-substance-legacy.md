### Towards open digital publishing


Substance is a Javascript library for developing rich editing experiences. From simple text editors to full-featured publishing systems: Substance provides you reliable building blocks to realize your project.

**Custom document models**: Define a custom article schema, by including common content types, such as paragraphs and headings and defining custom elements.

**Operation based manipulation**: Substance documents are manipulated with operations that can be undone, redone and distributed over a network for concurrent manipulations (collaborative editing)

**HTML/XML import export:** Substance interacts well with HTML/XML content. E.g. you can import whole XML documents or insert HTML fragments from the clipboard.

**Server and client-side execution**: Substance runs in the browser and server-side environments, such as Node.js or io.js.
