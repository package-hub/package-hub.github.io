## [json_api_client](https://github.com/JsonApiClient/json_api_client)

### Build client libraries compliant with specification defined by jsonapi.org


This gem is meant to help you build an API client for interacting with REST APIs as laid out by [http://jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org). It attempts to give you a query building framework that is easy to understand (it is similar to ActiveRecord scopes).

*Note: master is currently tracking the 1.0.0 specification. If you're looking for the older code, see [0.x branch](https://github.com/JsonApiClient/json_api_client/tree/0.x)*
