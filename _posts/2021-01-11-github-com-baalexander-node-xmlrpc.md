## [node-xmlrpc](https://github.com/baalexander/node-xmlrpc)

### A pure JavaScript XML-RPC client and server for Node.js.


The xmlrpc module is a pure JavaScript XML-RPC server and client for node.js.

Pure JavaScript means that the [XML parsing](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js)
and [XML building](https://github.com/robrighter/node-xml) use pure JavaScript
libraries, so no extra C dependencies or build requirements. The xmlrpc module
can be used as an XML-RPC server, receiving method calls and responding with
method responses, or as an XML-RPC client, making method calls and receiving
method responses, or as both.
