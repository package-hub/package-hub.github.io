### An unofficial third-party library of discord.py for discord components.


Discord components are cool, but discord.py will support it on version 2.0. It
is hard to wait, so we made a third-party library for using components such as
buttons or selects!

This project is open source ‚≠ê.

Also, there is an [official discord server](https://discord.gg/pKM6stqPxS), so
if you have any questions, feel free to ask it on this server.
