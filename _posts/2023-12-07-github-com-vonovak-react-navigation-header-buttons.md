### Easily render header buttons for react-navigation


This package will help you render buttons in the navigation bar and handle the styling, so you don't have to. It mimics the appearance of native navbar buttons and offers a simple but also flexible interface for you to interact with.

✅ DRY library api

✅ Works great with icons from `@expo/vector-icons` / `react-native-vector-icons` or any other icon library

✅ Supports both [JS](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator) and [native](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/) stack

✅ Beautiful overflow menus for items that don't fit into the navbar

✅ [Recipes](#recipes) and examples included

✅ Written in TS
