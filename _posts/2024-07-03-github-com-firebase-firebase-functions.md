### Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions


The `firebase-functions` package provides an SDK for defining Cloud Functions for Firebase.

Cloud Functions is a hosted, private, and scalable Node.js environment where you can run JavaScript code. The Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions integrates the Firebase platform by letting you write code that responds to events and invokes functionality exposed by other Firebase features.
