### Android keyboard for secure E2EE communication through the signal protocol in any messenger. Communicate securely and independent, regardless of the legal situation or whether messengers use E2EE


Breaking of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by laws such as the planned EU chat control is an ongoing
issue. Content in messengers that use E2EE, such as Whatsapp or Signal, could thus be monitored by
third parties. E2EE is often, but not always, standard in messengers. There are proven methods for
E2EE such as PGP. However, these methods are sometimes cumbersomely integrated and require a lot of
effort to use.

KryptEY is an Android keyboard that implements the Signal protocol. The keyboard works
messenger-independently and both the X3DH Key Agreement Protocol and the Double Ratchet Algorithm
work without a server, thus it enables a highly independent use of the protocol.
