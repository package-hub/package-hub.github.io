### A modern data workflow platform


We've rebuilt data engineering for the data science era.

Prefect is a new workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine. Users organize `Tasks` into `Flows`, and Prefect takes care of the rest.

Read the [docs](https://docs.prefect.io); get the [code](#installation); ask us [anything](https://join.slack.com/t/prefect-community/shared_invite/enQtODQ3MTA2MjI4OTgyLTliYjEyYzljNTc2OThlMDE4YmViYzk3NDU4Y2EzMWZiODM0NmU3NjM0NjIyNWY0MGIxOGQzODMxNDMxYWYyOTE)!
