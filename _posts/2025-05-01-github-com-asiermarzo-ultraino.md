### Acoustic Field simulation for phased-array controllers

Acoustic Field simulation for phased-array controllers. The content of the folders is as follows:
- AcousticField3D. The simulator that runs on the PC and can control the driver boards
- Arduino MEGA 64 driver board code. Source code that goes in the Arduino Mega 64-channel driver board.
- DriverNano16. Source code for making an Arduino Nano a 16-channel driver board.
- Arduino phase detector. Code that goes in an Arduino Nano to serve as a tool to assign the channels.
- arrays. Bases for example arrays.
- driver board. BOM and PCB files for the driver board.
