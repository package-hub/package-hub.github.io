### Install, cache and run Cypress.io tests on CircleCI with minimal configuration.


The Cypress CircleCI Orb is a piece of configuration set in your `circle.yml` file to correctly install, cache and run [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) tests on CircleCI with very little effort. See this orb in [CircleCI Registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/cypress-io/cypress).
