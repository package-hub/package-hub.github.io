## [voldemort](https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort)

### An open source clone of Amazon's Dynamo.


_N.B.: Voldemort is no longer under development. LinkedIn was the primary maintainer and user of Voldemort, and stopped all production usage in 2018. Most of the Voldemort Read-Only use cases and some of the Read-Write use cases have migrated to [Venice](https://github.com/linkedin/venice), which is actively maintained and also open sourced._
