### LZ-based compression algorithm for JavaScript

Files have changed locations and name since a recent release. The new release file is in `libs/lz-string.min.js` (or in `libs/lz-string.js` if you don't care for the minified version)

Sorry about the mess in other repos. This will not happen again.
