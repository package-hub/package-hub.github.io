### Neural machine translation and sequence learning using TensorFlow


OpenNMT-tf is a general purpose sequence learning toolkit using TensorFlow 2. While neural machine translation is the main target task, it has been designed to more generally support:

* sequence to sequence mapping
* sequence tagging
* sequence classification
* language modeling

The project is production-oriented and comes with [backward compatibility guarantees](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
