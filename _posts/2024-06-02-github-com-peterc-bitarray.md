### Pure Ruby bit array/bitfield implementation


A simple, pure-Ruby 'bit field' object. Works well for Bloom filters (the use case for which I originally wrote it, although there are numerous good libraries for that task now).

Despite its age, BitArray has been updated to work within a typical, modern Ruby environment, but is only 'mildly' maintained.
