### Process monitoring tool. Inspired from Bluepill and God.


We have used god and bluepill in production and always ran into bugs (segfaults, crashes, lost processes, kill not-related processes, load problems, deploy problems, ...)

We wanted something more robust and production stable.

We wanted the features of bluepill and god, with a few extras like chains, nested configuring, mask matching, easy debug configs

I hope we've succeeded, we're using eye in production and are quite happy.
