A tool for converting dictionary files aka glossaries.

The primary purpose is to be able to use our offline glossaries in any Open
Source dictionary we like on any OS/device.

There are countless formats, and my time is limited, so I implement formats that
seem more useful for myself, or for Open Source community. Also diversity of
languages is taken into account. Pull requests are welcome.
