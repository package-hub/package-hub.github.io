### A Redux middleware to handle WebSocket connections.


`redux-websocket` is a Redux middleware for managing data over a WebSocket connection.

This middleware uses actions to interact with a WebSocket connection including connecting, disconnecting, sending messages, and receiving messages. All actions follow the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) model.
