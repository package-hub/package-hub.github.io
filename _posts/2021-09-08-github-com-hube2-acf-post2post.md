### Automatic Two Way (Bidirectional) Relationships with ACF5 Pro


Creates two way (bidirectional) relationships in Advanced Custom Fields

This plugin will provide no functionality if ACF is not installed and active.

This plugin does not create a new type of field or any admin interface. This plugin when used as explained below makes the
existing ACF Relationship and Post Object fields work bi-directionaly, automatically updating the relationship field on
the other end of the relationship.

A couple of months after I created this plugin the developer posted a tutorial on how to do this using a filter.
That example basically does the same thing except it seems to require the fields to have the same key as well
as the same name where this plugin will let you mix fields as long as they are of a type that allows a relationship
and they have the same name.
