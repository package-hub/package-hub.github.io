### TAGG :: threads_a_gogo :: Simple and fast JavaScript threads for Node.js


Threads Ã  gogo ([*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_gogo)) is a native module for Node.js that provides an asynchronous, evented and/or continuation passing style API for moving blocking/longish CPU-bound tasks out of Node's event loop to JavaScript threads that run in parallel in the background and that use all the available CPU cores automatically; all from within **a single Node** process.
