### ðŸ”Œ TypeScript bindings for Ethereum smart contracts


- static typing - you will never call not existing method again
- IDE support - works with any IDE supporting Typescript
- extendible - work with many different APIs: `ethers.js v4`, `truffle v4`, `truffle v5`, `Web3.js v1` or you can create
  your own target
- frictionless - works with simple, JSON ABI files as well as with Truffle style ABIs
