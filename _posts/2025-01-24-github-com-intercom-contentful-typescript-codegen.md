### Generate TypeScript interfaces from a Contentful environment


Generate typings from your Contentful environment.

- Content Types become interfaces.
- Locales (and your default locale) become string types.
- Assets and Rich Text link to Contentful's types.

At Intercom, we use this in our [website] to increase developer confidence and productivity,
ensure that breaking changes to our Content Types don't cause an outage, and because it's neat.
