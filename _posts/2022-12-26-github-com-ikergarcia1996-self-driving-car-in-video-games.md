### A deep neural network that learns to drive in video games

We provide pretrained T.E.D.D. 1104 models that you can use for real-time inference :)  
The models are trained using 130 GB of human labelled data.  
The model has been trained in first-person-view with a route to follow in the minimap.  
The model has learned to drive a large variety of vehicles in different weather conditions (Sun, night, sunny, rain...).  
For each model we provide the best and the last epoch.  
See [Software and HOW-TO Section](https://github.com/ikergarcia1996/Self-Driving-Car-in-Video-Games#software-and-how-to) for instructions on how run the models.
