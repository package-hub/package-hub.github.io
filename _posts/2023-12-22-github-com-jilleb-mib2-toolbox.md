### The ultimate MIB2-HIGH toolbox.

The ultimate MIB2-HIGH toolbox for all your MIB2 High customization needs.

Note: this screen has the potential to ruin your MIB2 HIGH unit. The developers are not responsible for any troubles to anyone or anything caused by this toolbox.
It's never our intention to harm any person, car or brand. Use the tools wisely, don't be a douche.

Note2: This is **not** a universal Jailbreak-like solution for all your needs and firmware versions.

Note3: If you're a business that tries to make a profit off of this:  Don't be an asshole, don't charge money for this. This project is done in our free time, out of love for the community. I've risked bricking my own hardware while testing, and invested a lot of time in the research. Instead of making money, why not support this project with your knowledge or a [small donation](https://paypal.me/chillout1) or become a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/jille).
