### A reliable org-capture browser extension for Chrome/Firefox

In the simplest setup, the server runs locally, and you can use 'localhost' version of the extension. If you have to work on a computer where you can't run python scripts,
or your target capture file is just not there, you can selfhost the server part elsewhere. Don't forget to set the endpoint in extension settings!
