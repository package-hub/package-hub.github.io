### Cryptomatte Nuke plugin, Fusion plugin, sample images, and specification


The contents of this repository are:

**Nuke:** This contains Python files, an image, and a gizmo. Together these are our implementation for Foundry's Nuke. In Nuke 13, there is also a [native implementation](https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/content/release_notes/nuke_13.0.html) which is similar to this one. This implementation is being kept active to allow for a smooth transition. 

**Fusion:** Fusion integration, including a Fuse file, a Lua module and a Fusion shortcut configuration file.

**Sample Images:** These example Cryptomatte images can be used for testing your Nuke installation, or for testing other implimentations. 

**Specification:** This is a technical document describing the Cryptomatte standard. It specifies how Cryptomattes are structured, encoded, and decoded. It also contains our SIGGRAPH 2015 poster on the subject.
