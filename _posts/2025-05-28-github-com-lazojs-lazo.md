## [lazo](https://github.com/lazojs/lazo)

### A client-server web framework built on Node.js that allows front-end developers to easily create a 100% SEO compliant, component MVC structured web application with an optimized first page load.

The single page application ([SPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) model is an excellent
approach for separating application logic from data retrieval; consolidating UI code to a single language and run
time; and delegating rendering to browsers. However, the SPA model fails to adequately address SEO concerns and
time to first page render making it a major concern for any public facing website. As such, developers rely on
work-arounds such as the hashbang hack or running the DOM on the server so they can realize the benefits of the
SPA model and address SEO concerns. These work-arounds, however, have significant performance and maintenance drawbacks.
