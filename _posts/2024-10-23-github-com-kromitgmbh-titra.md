### titra - modern open source project time tracking for freelancers and small teams

Modern open source project time tracking for freelancers and small teams

We believe in the philosophy ["Do One Thing And Do It Well."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well) and try to follow it in the design and implementation of titra. A great companion for titra is [Wekan](https://wekan.github.io/), where you can plan your tasks and track your time against later on.
