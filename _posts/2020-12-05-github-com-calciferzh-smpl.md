## [SMPL](https://github.com/CalciferZh/SMPL)

### NumPy, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementation of human body SMPL model and infant body SMIL model.


Numpy, TensorFlow and PyTorch implementation of SMPL model. For C++ implementation (with PyTorch), please see this [repo](https://github.com/YeeCY/SMPLpp).

**Notes:**
* If you want to estimate SMPL parameters from a set of sparse keypoint coordinates, please check [this repo](https://github.com/CalciferZh/Minimal-IK).
* The model file **cannot** be provided due to copyright reasons.
* This project **cannot** fit a SMPL model to a scan - you can check this [paper](https://ps.is.mpg.de/publications/shape_under_cloth-cvpr17).
