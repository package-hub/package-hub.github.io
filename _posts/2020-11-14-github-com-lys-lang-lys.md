### ⚜︎ A language that compiles to WebAssembly


- To learn what can be used so far: browse the [standard library](https://github.com/lys-lang/lys/tree/master/stdlib/system)
- To learn how real code looks like: browse the [execution tests](https://github.com/lys-lang/lys/tree/master/test/fixtures/execution)
- To learn how high level constructs get compiled: browse the [sugar syntax tests](https://github.com/lys-lang/lys/tree/master/test/fixtures/semantics)
- To start developing it locally, I do `make watch` and then I run the tests in other terminal with `make snapshot`
- To see an example project: browse the [keccak repo](https://github.com/lys-lang/keccak)
