## [bi-att-flow](https://github.com/allenai/bi-att-flow)

### Bi-directional Attention Flow (BiDAF) network is a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents context at different levels of granularity and uses a bi-directional attention flow mechanism to achieve a query-aware context representation without early summarization.

 
- This the original implementation of [Bi-directional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension][paper].
- The CodaLab worksheet for the [SQuAD Leaderboard][squad] submission is available [here][worksheet].
