### Rap song writing recurrent neural network trained on Kanye West's entire discography

This is a generative art project I made for my high school's programming club - which ~I'm the president/founder of~ I was the president/founder of until I graduated.

It's a neural network that has been trained on Kanye West's discography, and can use any lyrics you feed it and write a new song *word by word* that rhymes and has a flow (to an extent).

Quartz did a really nice profile on me and the program here; https://qz.com/920091/a-west-virginia-teen-taught-himself-how-to-build-a-rapping-ai-using-kanye-west-lyrics/
