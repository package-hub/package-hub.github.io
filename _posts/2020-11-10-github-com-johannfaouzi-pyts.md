### A Python package for time series classification


pyts is a Python package for time series classification. It
aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing
preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of
state-of-the-art algorithms. Most of these algorithms transform time series,
thus pyts provides several tools to perform these transformations.
