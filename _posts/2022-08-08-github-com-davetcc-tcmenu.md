### Menu library for Arduino, mbed and ESP with designer UI and remote control capabilities.


A menu library and designer UI for Arduino and mbed that is modular enough to support different input methods, display modules and IoT / remote control methods. TcMenu is more than just an Arduino menu library, think of it as a framework for building IoT applications that includes the ability to render menus locally onto a display.

Initially, you can use the menu designer UI that is packaged with every release, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The designer UI takes care of building the core menu code and putting any callback functions into your sketch file. Think of the designer like a form designer in the desktop domain. Furthermore, It's non destructive on the sketch file, so can be round tripped during development.
