###  Use TypeScript in your Ember.js apps!


ember-cli-typescript will no longer be updated unless necessary  - ec-ts is no longer needed and all available features are configurable in userland.

See the official TypeScript docs on the ember guides website here: https://guides.emberjs.com/release/typescript/ 
This section of the docs has details for getting started with TypeScript, beyond what is laid out here.

With every release, we output the `--typescript` output of new ember apps to this StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/ember-cli/editor-output/tree/stackblitz-app-output-typescript
