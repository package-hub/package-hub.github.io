### TwelveMonkeys ImageIO: Additional plug-ins and extensions for Java's ImageIO


TwelveMonkeys ImageIO provides extended image file format support for the Java platform, through plugins for the `javax.imageio.*` package.

The main goal of this project is to provide support for file formats not covered by the JDK. 
Support for these formats is important, to be able to read data found
"in the wild", as well as to maintain access to data in legacy formats.
As there is lots of legacy data out there, we see the need for open implementations of readers for popular formats.
