## [omniscient](https://github.com/omniscientjs/omniscient)

### A library providing an abstraction for React components that allows for fast top-down rendering embracing immutable data for js

**We can happily announce that as of [React 16.6](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html), Omniscient.js can enjoy retirement after a job well done. The new [`React.memo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) API can for most cases replace the Omniscient decorator with your own `areEqual` function. It's not exactly the same, but we feel that it is close enough for most cases. Thanks for supporting Omniscient all these years.**

> Do fast top-down rendering embracing immutable data and functional programming.

> Omniscient pairs the simplicity of [Quiescent](https://github.com/levand/quiescent) with
the cursors of [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om), for js, using
[Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js).
