### Addon for Cookie Clicker that offers a wide range of tools and statistics to enhance the game


**Cookie Monster** is an addon you can load into Cookie Clicker, that offers a wide range of tools and statistics to enhance the game. **It is not a cheat interface** – although it does offer helpers for golden cookies and such, everything can be toggled off at will to only leave how much information you want.
The mod helps you to *whichever* degree you want, if you only need some help shortening long numbers, it does that. If you need to be accompanied by hand to pick the best buildings to buy, it does that, but **everything is an option**.
