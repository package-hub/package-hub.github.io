### JaVers - object auditing and diff framework for Java


JaVers is the lightweight Java library for **auditing** changes in your data.

We all use Version Control Systems for source code,
so why not use a specialized framework to provide
an audit trail of your Java objects (entities, POJO, data objects)?
