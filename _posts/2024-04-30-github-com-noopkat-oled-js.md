### :tv: johnny-five compatible lib for OLED screens


This repo is a library compatible with Rick Waldron's [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) project. It adds support for I2C/SPI compatible monochrome OLED screens. Works with 128 x 32, 128 x 64 and 96 x 16 sized screens, of the SSD1306 OLED/PLED Controller (read the [datasheet here](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf)).

Got a [MicroView](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12923) from GeekAmmo/SparkFun? That'll work too.

OLED screens are really cool - now you can control them with JavaScript!
