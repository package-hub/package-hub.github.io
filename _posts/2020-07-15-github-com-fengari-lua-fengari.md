🐺 φεγγάρι - The Lua VM written in JS ES6 for Node and the browser

This repository contains the core fengari code (which is a port of the Lua C library) which includes parser, virtual machine and base libraries.
However it is rare to use this repository directly.

- To use fengari in a web browser as easily as you might use JavaScript, see [fengari-web](https://github.com/fengari-lua/fengari-web)
- [fengari-interop](https://github.com/fengari-lua/fengari-interop) is a lua library that makes interoperating with JavaScript objects simple, it is already included in fengari-web.
- For a clone of the `lua` command line tool, but running under node.js, see [fengari-node-cli](https://github.com/fengari-lua/fengari-node-cli)
