### (Blender 3.3) Universal batch export manager


* **Batch Exports** - Mark hundreds of objects and groups in a scene for export and export them all with one click. If you've made changes to assets in the scene and need to re-export them it's as simple as one more click.

* **Export Lists** - Get an overview of all objects prepared for export and quickly change their settings from the list menus.

* **Export Presets** - Create detailed and reusable export presets, supporting Alembic, Collada, FBX, GLTF, OBJ, STL and USD export formats.

* **Origin Point Export** - You can decide where the origin point is in your exports, no need to manually move around your objects before exporting.

* **Automated Folder Structures** - Capsule lets you automatically generate folders for your exports to help keep complex export setups organised.
