### Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (nilmtk)


Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of estimating the
energy consumed by individual appliances given just a whole-house
power meter reading.  In other words, it produces an (estimated)
itemised energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

NILMTK is a toolkit designed to help **researchers** evaluate the accuracy of NILM algorithms.
