## [PHPageBuilder](https://github.com/HansSchouten/PHPageBuilder)

### A drag and drop page builder to manage pages in any PHP project.

> PHPagebuilder is a drag and drop pagebuilder to manage pages in any PHP project.

PHPagebuilder can be used as an ultra lightweight CMS to quickly spin up new websites, or can be integrated into existing projects or your favorite frameworks (such as [this version](https://github.com/HansSchouten/Laravel-Pagebuilder) for Laravel). The server-side code does not depend on any other libraries and is blazing fast. It includes an optional website manager with a [Bootstrap UI](https://getbootstrap.com) and integrates the most popular open source drag and drop pagebuilder: [GrapesJS](https://grapesjs.com/). This package is made with customization in mind, allowing you to configure, disable or replace any of its modules.
