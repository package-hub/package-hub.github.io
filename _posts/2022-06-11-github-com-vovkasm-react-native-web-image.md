### An image component for react-native with persistent disk and memory caching.


An image component for react-native with persistent disk and memory caching.

It is mostly a wrapper around native libraries which actually do the hard work.
On Android it uses [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), on iOS â€“
[SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage).

:warning: The package is currently in alpha stage of development. If you find a bug or missing functionality, please feel free to report, but better fix or implement what you want and send a pull request to GitHub repository.
