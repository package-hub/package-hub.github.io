### RGL is a framework for graph data structures and algorithms in Ruby.


RGL is a framework for graph data structures and algorithms.

The design of the library is much influenced by the Boost Graph Library (BGL)
which is written in C++. Refer to https://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc for
further links and documentation on graph data structures and algorithms and
the design rationales of BGL.

A comprehensive summary of graph terminology can be found in the graph section
of the *Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures* at
https://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/graph.html or
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29).
