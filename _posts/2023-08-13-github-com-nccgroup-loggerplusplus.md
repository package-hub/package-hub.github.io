If you'd like to build the project from source, the project uses Gradle to simplify the process:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nccgroup/LoggerPlusPlus.git`
2. Within the project folder, execute `gradlew jar` (Linux) `gradlew.bat jar` (Windows)
3. Once complete, you can find the built Jar in the project's `releases` folder.
