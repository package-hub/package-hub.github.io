### The browser prompter for macOS


If you enjoy using Browserosaurus, please consider supporting its continued
development.

Browserosaurus is an open-source (MIT license), Electron-based browser prompter
for macOS. It works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links
in non-browser apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where it’ll present you with
a menu of all your installed browsers. You may now decide which browser you’d
like to continue opening the link with.

**Currently supports macOS 11.1.0**
