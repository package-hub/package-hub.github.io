### GS Collections has been migrated to the Eclipse Foundation, re-branded as Eclipse Collections.  https://www.eclipse.org/collections/

We are pleased to announce that GS Collections has been migrated to [the Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/org/foundation/), re-branded as [Eclipse Collections](https://www.eclipse.org/collections/).

Eclipse Collections 7.0 has the exact same feature set as GS Collections 7.0.

Going forward, any new features will be developed in Eclipse Collections. We will only port critical bug fixes to GS Collections.
To support smooth migration for users, we implemented a conversion application [gsc-ec-converter](https://github.com/eclipse/gsc-ec-converter). Please plan your migration accordingly from GS Collections to Eclipse Collections.
