### PHP AGI ( Asterisk Gateway Interface ) facade, with CDR ( Call Detail Record ), Call spool and schedule auto dial, Send and Receive Fax, Channel Variables,  and Caller ID management


This framework is intended to simply making ivr applications using Asterisk's
AGI, providing a nice level of abstraction over what an IVR should look like
from a developers' perspective.
