## [realtime-js](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js)

### An isomorphic Javascript client for Supabase Realtime server.


This client enables you to use the following Supabase Realtime's features:

- **Broadcast**: send ephemeral messages from client to clients with minimal latency. Use cases include sharing cursor positions between users.
- **Presence**: track and synchronize shared state across clients with the help of CRDTs. Use cases include tracking which users are currently viewing a specific webpage.
- **Postgres Change Data Capture (CDC)**: listen for changes in your PostgreSQL database and send them to clients.
