### An awesome browser extension that reads aloud webpage content with one click

>First impressions are super. Natural flowing voice and very helpful for multitasking and also giving my eyes a rest.

> Thank you so much for this extension. I absolutely swear by it whenever I need to read any large chunk of text. The combination of hearing it in a clear voice (...)  Its fantastic, thank you so much.

*David*

> This is a phenomenal extension. Better than anything else I tryed so far. Simple, easy, customizable (...) I would recommend this whole heartedly to anyone who has dyslexia like me, or any other reasons for not beeing able to read comfortably at all times.
