### Plex @ aTV - think different...

or: "Plex @ aTV - think different..."

PlexConnect is an app that allows AppleTV2 and AppleTV3 to be used as Plex clients. Development started in 2013 and finished in 2015 (when AppleTV4 was announced), as described in this [Plex Forum thread][].

There are two options to install PlexConnect:
- If you applied a jailbreak to your aTV you can install PlexConnect on it. This is the preferred way
- If your aTV has no jailbreak then you need to install PlexConnect on a separate device (probably in the same server where Plex Media Server is running)
