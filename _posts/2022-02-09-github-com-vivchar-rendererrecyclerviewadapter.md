## [RendererRecyclerViewAdapter](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter)

### A single adapter with multiple view types for the whole project


* [Now you do not need to implement adapters for RecyclerView](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-the-Renderer-Adapter);
* [You can easily use several types of cells in a single list](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-Simple-Items);
* [You can reuse cells in different RecyclerView](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-Simple-Items);
* [You can easily add a nested RecyclerView](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-Composite-Items);
* [You can easily add the DiffUtil](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-DiffUtil);
* [You can easily add the DiffUtil Payloads](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/blob/master/example/src/main/java/com/github/vivchar/example/pages/simple/PayloadFragment.java#L43);
* [You can easily save a state of a Item when scroll](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-ViewState);
* [You can easily add a Load More Indicator](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-Load-More-Indicator);
* [Can be used without ViewHolder - use ViewBinder instead of ViewRenderer](https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter/wiki/Quick-start-with-View-Binder);
* Using this library will help you to follow SOLID principles.
