### A Java HTTP client for consuming Twitter's realtime Streaming API

A Java HTTP client for consuming Twitter's standard [Streaming API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview)

!! Note that, as of August 16th, 2018, the [user streams and site streams features have been retired](https://twittercommunity.com/t/reminder-site-streams-user-streams-and-legacy-dm-endpoints-will-be-sunset-august-16th/109482), so code that attempts to connect to these endpoints will no longer work.
