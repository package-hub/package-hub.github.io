### Keep all your WordPress code on git with a simple plugin and a repo


Gitium was built in 2013 to provide our clients a more simple and error-free method to integrate a new git version control into their code management flow.

Gitium was developed by the awesome engineering team at [Presslabs](https://www.presslabs.com/), a Managed WordPress Hosting provider.
