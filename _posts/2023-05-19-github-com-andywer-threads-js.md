## [threads.js](https://github.com/andywer/threads.js)

### ðŸ§µ Make web workers & worker threads as simple as a function call.


* First-class support for **async functions** & **observables**
* Write code once, run it **on all platforms**
* Manage bulk task executions with **thread pools**
* Use **require()** and **import**/**export** in workers
* Works great with **webpack**
