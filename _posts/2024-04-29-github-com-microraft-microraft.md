### Feature-complete implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Java


MicroRaft implements the leader election, log replication, log compaction
(snapshotting), and cluster membership changes components of the Raft consensus
algorithm. Additionally, it offers a rich set of optimizations and
enhancements:

* Adaptive batching during log replication,
* Back pressure to prevent OOMEs on Raft leader and followers,
* Parallel snapshot transfer from Raft leader and followers,
* Pre-voting and leader stickiness ([Section 4.2.3 of the Raft dissertation](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation) and [Four modifications of the Raft consensus algorithm](https://openlife.cc/system/files/4-modifications-for-Raft-consensus.pdf)),
* Auto-demotion of Raft leader on loss of quorum heartbeats [(Section 6.2 of the Raft dissertation)](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation),
* Linearizable quorum reads without appending log entries [(Section 6.4 of the Raft dissertation)](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation),
* Lease-based local queries on Raft leader [(Section 6.4.1 of the Raft dissertation)](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation),
* Monotonic local queries on Raft followers [(Section 6.4.1 of the Raft dissertation)](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation),
* Parallel disk writes on Raft leader and followers [(Section 10.2.1 of the Raft dissertation)](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation),
* Leadership transfer [(Section 3.10 of the Raft dissertation)](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation).
