## [TediCross](https://github.com/TediCross/TediCross)

### Bot which bridges Telegram chats with Discord channels


Anything capable of running [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) should be able to run TediCross. People have had success running it on ordinary laptops, raspberry pis, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and other machines. It runs on both Linux and Windows, and probably also macOS. It does NOT, however, run on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

The machine must be on for TediCross to work
