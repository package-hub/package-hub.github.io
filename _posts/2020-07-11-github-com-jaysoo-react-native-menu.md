### A flexible dropdown menu component for Android and iOS that is similar to Android's Spinner.


A menu component for Android and iOS that provides a dropdown similar to Android's
[Spinner](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Spinner.html), but does not
retain a persistent selection.

The API is very flexible so you are free to extend the styling and behaviour.
