### Google Sheets™ ESI Add-on


Google Sheets™ add-on for interacting with EVE ESI API.  GESI provides an EVE Online SSO flow to authorize your character(s), as well as a wrapper around ESI in order to access your EVE Online data within Google Sheets™; much like `=importXML()` worked with the old XML API.
