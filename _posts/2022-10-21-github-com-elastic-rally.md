### Macrobenchmarking framework for Elasticsearch


You want to benchmark Elasticsearch? Then Rally is for you. It can help you with the following tasks:

* Setup and teardown of an Elasticsearch cluster for benchmarking
* Management of benchmark data and specifications even across Elasticsearch versions
* Running benchmarks and recording results
* Finding performance problems by attaching so-called telemetry devices
* Comparing performance results

We have also put considerable effort in Rally to ensure that benchmarking data are reproducible.
