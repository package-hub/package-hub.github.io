### Make your async components compact and descriptive by leveraging the power of the language features


    npm install react-coroutine

> **Coroutines** are computer program components that generalize subroutines for nonpreemptive multitasking, by allowing multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing more familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loop, iterators, infinite lists and pipes.  
> â€” _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine)_

Describe complex async state flows in your React components using only language
features like [generators][1], [async functions][2], and [async generators][3].

No API or new abstractions to learn, only JavaScript code as it intended to be.
