`cast_control` is [a daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) utility that allows you to control media playback on casting devices from the Linux desktop.

While this service runs, it collects data about the media and apps playing on your casting devices and displays it on your computer.
