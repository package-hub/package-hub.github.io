### SABnzbd - The automated Usenet download tool


SABnzbd has a few dependencies you'll need before you can get running. If you've previously run SABnzbd from one of the various Linux packages, then you likely already have all the needed dependencies. If not, here's what you're looking for:

- `python` (Python 3.8 and above, often called `python3`)
- Python modules listed in `requirements.txt`. Install with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt -U`
- `par2` (Multi-threaded par2 installation guide can be found [here](https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/installation/multicore-par2))
- `unrar` (make sure you get the "official" non-free version of unrar)

Optional:
- See `requirements.txt`

Your package manager should supply these. If not, we've got links in our [installation guide](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/blob/master/INSTALL.txt).
