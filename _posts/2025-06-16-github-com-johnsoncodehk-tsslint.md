### 🔋⚡️ The fastest and lightest TypeScript semantic linting solution


> A lightweight inspection tool that seamlessly integrates with TypeScript Language Server

TSSLint is not your typical linter. Its main purpose is to expose the TypeScript Language Server diagnostic interface, allowing you to add your own diagnostic rules without additional overhead to creating a TypeChecker.
