## [py-todo](https://github.com/aesophor/py-todo)

### ðŸ“‹ Lightweight reminder / todo-list in cli

A little program to remind you of upcoming events / unfinished tasks.

Put them into `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` or whatever you want, and it will stop you from
putting off important shit.

Pickled (i.e., serialized) todo list objects are saved in ~/.local/share/py-todo/todo.dat by default.
