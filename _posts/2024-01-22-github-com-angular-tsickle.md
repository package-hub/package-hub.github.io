### Tsickle â€” TypeScript to Closure Translator


Tsickle converts TypeScript code into a form acceptable to the [Closure
Compiler]. This allows using TypeScript to transpile your sources, and then
using Closure Compiler to bundle and optimize them, while taking advantage of
type information in Closure Compiler.
