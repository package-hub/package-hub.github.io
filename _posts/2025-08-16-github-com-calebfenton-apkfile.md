### Android app analysis and feature extraction library


ApkFile is a library which creates a representation of an APK composed of Java objects which can be easily inspected for analysis or serialized into JSON. The goal of the library is to provide a robust way to inspect hostile malware samples, but it's general purpose enough to be used for other stuff too.

This library and [APKiD](https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD) provide the machine learning feature extraction for [Judge](http://judge.rednaga.io/), an Android malware detection engine.
