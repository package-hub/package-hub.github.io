### A Zotero plugin to remove the broken & duplicate attachment link of the bibliography


A Zotero plugin to remove the broken & duplicate attachment link of the bibliography

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-storage-scanner/releases/latest).

This plugin scans your attachments of storage to remove the missing & duplicate attachment link. The combination of the duplicated bibliography in Zotero could create a lot of duplicate attachments. Also when you use a plugin/ third-party software to directly remove the PDF of the bibliography, the attachment link becomes broken in Zotero. This plugin is designed to solve the problem.

Install by downloading the latest version and installing it from the Zotero add-ons screen.
