### Fullstack Symfony CMS: The perfect mix between a framework and a CMS


Victoire is a **Symfony** overlay integrating a Dynamic-CMS that use the core business datas in a dynamic and automated way.
It can be setup in any Symfony project in just some few minutes.

The main goal is to give to the final customer the ability to **create**/**edit**/**delete** each content on its website, as much for a static content than a business entity based content and **without any development skill**, with the minimum of training.

Victoire is the first CMS ever that allows content's personalization! Indeed you can define which content is shown regarding the criterias you define.

Many criterias can be used such as website locale, log in status, and so much more that can be created for each particular project.

A french documentation has been started and is being completed _slowly_ [here](http://github.com/victoire/documentation-fr/).
