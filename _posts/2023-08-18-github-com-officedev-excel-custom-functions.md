### Learn about custom functions in Excel.


Custom functions enable you to add new functions to Excel by defining those functions in JavaScript as part of an add-in. Users within Excel can access custom functions just as they would any native function in Excel, such as `SUM()`.  

This repository contains the source code used by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) when you create a new custom functions project. You can also use this repository as a sample to base your own custom functions project from if you choose not to use the generator. For more detailed information about custom functions in Excel, see the [Custom functions overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-overview) article in the Office Add-ins documentation or see the [additional resources](#additional-resources) section of this repository.
