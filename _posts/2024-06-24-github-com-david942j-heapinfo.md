### An interactive memory info for pwning / exploiting

As pwn lovers, while playing CTF with heap exploitation, we always need a debugger (e.g. gdb) for tracking memory layout. But we don't really need gdb if we want to see whether the heap layout same as our imagination or not. Hope this small tool helps us exploit easier ;).
