### Other tools to transcode videos.


Other tools to transcode videos.

> [!NOTE]
> *This project is still being maintained but development is not very active. Why? Because I'm focusing my energy on the redesigned and rewritten version of `transcode-video.rb` from my [Video Transcoding](https://github.com/lisamelton/video_transcoding) project. And I would recommend using that tool instead of `other-transcode.rb` because it's much less complex while still leveraging the modern era of transcoding technology.*
