### JavaScript project for accessing and normalizing the accelerometer and gyroscope data on mobile devices

Accesses the gyroscope and accelerometer data from the web browser and combines them in one JS object.

It returns consistent values across different devices. It has options to return game-based or world-based alpha values (rotation around z-axis), and normalize the gravity-related values. You can find more about the differences across devices in the e-book.
