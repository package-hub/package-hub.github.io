### TensorFlow implementation of the Xception Model by François Chollet

TensorFlow implementation of the Xception Model by François Chollet, based on the paper:
[Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)

As an example, the model will be trained on the Flowers dataset.
