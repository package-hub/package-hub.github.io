### JPHP - an implementation of PHP on Java VM


We develop a new IDE for beginners like `Game Maker` or `Scirra Construct`. It's based on JPHP, JavaFX, Java 8, Gradle and allows to create desktop games and apps for Linux, Windows and Mac (maybe Android and other platforms in future). The project name is `DevelNext` (https://github.com/jphp-group/develnext-ide), the current status and version of the project is BETA. The project has not yet been localized in English.
