### At-a-glance dashboard for Raspberry Pi with a Waveshare ePaper 7.5 Inch HAT. Date/Time, Weather, Alerts, Google/Outlook Calendar


[Waveshare 7.5 inch epaper display HAT 640x384](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075R4QY3L/)  
[Raspberry Pi Zero WH (presoldered header)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07BHMRTTY/)  
[microSDHC card](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073K14CVB)  

Optional - a picture frame. I used a [18x13cm (7x5 inch) frame](https://www.tescophoto.com/harriet-photo-frame) which just about fits the screen.
