### A Python framework for sequence labeling evaluation(named-entity recognition, pos tagging, etc...)


seqeval is a Python framework for sequence labeling evaluation.
seqeval can evaluate the performance of chunking tasks such as named-entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, semantic role labeling and so on.

This is well-tested by using the Perl script [conlleval](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/bin/conlleval.txt),
which can be used for measuring the performance of a system that has processed the CoNLL-2000 shared task data.
