## [higlass](https://github.com/higlass/higlass)

### Fast, flexible and extensible genome browser.


HiGlass is a web-based viewer for datasets too large to view at once.
It features synchronized navigation of multiple views as well as continuous zooming and panning
for navigation across genomic loci and resolutions. It supports visual comparison of
genomic (e.g., Hi-C, ChIP-seq, or bed annotations) and other data (e.g., geographic maps, gigapixel images, or abstract 1D and 2D sequential data) from different experimental conditions and can be used to efficiently
identify salient outcomes of experimental perturbations, generate new hypotheses, and share
the results with the community.

A live instance can be found at [http://higlass.io](http://higlass.io). A [Docker container](https://github.com/higlass/higlass-docker) is available for running an instance locally, although we recommend using the [higlass-manage](https://github.com/pkerpedjiev/higlass-manage) package to start, stop and configure local instances.

For documentation about how to use and install HiGlass, please visit [http://docs.higlass.io](http://docs.higlass.io).
