### Full featured SQLite3 Native Plugin for React Native (Android and iOS)

SQLite3 Native Plugin for React Native for both Android (Classic and Native), iOS and Windows

Foundation of this library is based on Chris Brody's Cordova SQLite plugin.

Features:
  1. iOS and Android supported via identical JavaScript API.
  2. Android in pure Java and Native modes
  3. SQL transactions
  4. JavaScript interface via plain callbacks or Promises.
  5. Pre-populated SQLite database import from application bundle and sandbox

There are sample apps provided in test directory that can be used in with the AwesomeProject generated by React Native. All you have to do is to copy one of those files into your AwesomeProject replacing index.ios.js.

Please let me know your projects that use these SQLite React Native modules. I will list them in the reference section. If there are any features that you think would benefit this library please post them.

The library has been tested with React 16.2 (and earlier) and XCode 7,8,9 - it works fine out of the box without any need for tweaks or code changes. For XCode 7,8 vs. XCode 6 the only difference is that sqlite ios library name suffix is tbd instead of dylib.

Version 3.2 is the first version compatible with RN 0.40.
