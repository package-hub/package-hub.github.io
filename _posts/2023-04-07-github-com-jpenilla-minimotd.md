## [MiniMOTD](https://github.com/jpenilla/MiniMOTD)

### Minecraft server/proxy plugin to set the server list MOTD using MiniMessage for formatting, supporting RGB colors.


- MiniMOTD supports RGB colors and gradients through [MiniMessage](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure-text-minimessage), which is also where MiniMOTD gets it's name.
- For more detailed info on formatting text, refer to the [MiniMessage docs](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html).
- RGB colors are automatically downsampled for outdated clients.
- RGB colors are only able to be sent by proxies and 1.16+ servers, and can only be seen by 1.16+ clients.
