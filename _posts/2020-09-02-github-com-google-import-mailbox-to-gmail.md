### Import .mbox files into G Suite


This script allows G Suite admins to import mbox files in bulk for their
users.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is not an official Google product.

If you want to migrate from Mozilla Thunderbird, try
[mail-importer](https://github.com/google/mail-importer).

You only authorize it once using a service account, and then it can import mail
into the mailboxes of all users in your domain.
