### PIPE - Platform Independent Petri Net Editor


A tool for creating and analysing Petri nets, migrated from [Sourceforge](http://pipe2.sourceforge.net/about.html). A user-guide can be found [here](http://sarahtattersall.github.io/PIPE/) for how to use PIPE 5's features.

PIPE 5 is currently in beta stage due to an entire re-write of the back end and so is missing most of the analysis modules. If you require Petri net analysis, please use PIPE 4.
