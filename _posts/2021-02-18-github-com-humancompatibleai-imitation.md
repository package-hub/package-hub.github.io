### Clean PyTorch implementations of imitation learning algorithms


This project aims to provide clean implementations of imitation learning algorithms.
Currently we have implementations of Behavioral Cloning, [DAgger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.0686.pdf) (with synthetic examples), [Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248), and [Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476).
