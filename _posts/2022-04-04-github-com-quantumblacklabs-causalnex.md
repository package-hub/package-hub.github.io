## [causalnex](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/causalnex)

### A Python library that helps data scientists to infer causation rather than observing correlation.


> "A toolkit for causal reasoning with Bayesian Networks."

CausalNex aims to become one of the leading libraries for causal reasoning and "what-if" analysis using Bayesian Networks. It helps to simplify the steps:
 - To learn causal structures,
 - To allow domain experts to augment the relationships,
 - To estimate the effects of potential interventions using data.
