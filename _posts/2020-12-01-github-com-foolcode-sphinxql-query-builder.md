## [SphinxQL-Query-Builder](https://github.com/FoolCode/SphinxQL-Query-Builder)

### SphinxQL Query Builder generates SphinxQL, a SQL dialect, which is used to query the Sphinx search engine. (Composer Package)


This is a SphinxQL Query Builder used to work with SphinxQL, a SQL dialect used with the Sphinx search engine and it's fork Manticore. It maps most of the functions listed in the [SphinxQL reference](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#SphinxQL-reference) and is generally [faster](http://sphinxsearch.com/blog/2010/04/25/sphinxapi-vs-SphinxQL-benchmark/) than the available Sphinx API.

This Query Builder has no dependencies except PHP 5.6, `\MySQLi` extension, `PDO`, and [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com)/[Manticore](https://manticoresearch.com).
