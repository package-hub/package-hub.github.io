### Markdown syntax highlighting for Notepad++, by customized UDL file (user defined language)


This repo "markdown-plus-plus" is a project to support Markdown syntax highlighting in [Notepad++][npp_site]. It is done via various **User Defined Language (UDL) XML files**. All UDLs are carefully designed by human, rather than generated by machine.

You can simply consume the UDL XML file that matches your favorite theme, or config your own using the build system.

Thanks for encouragements and comments. This repo is not only for myself anymore. It's for everyone.

Love Notepad++? Need to write docs in Markdown? This repo is made for you.
