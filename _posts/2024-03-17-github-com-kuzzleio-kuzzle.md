### Open-source Back-end, self-hostable & ready to use - Real-time, storage, advanced search - Web, Apps, Mobile, IoT -


Kuzzle is a [generic backend](https://docs.kuzzle.io/core/2/guides/introduction/general-purpose-backend/) offering **the basic building blocks common to every application**.

Rather than developing the same standard features over and over again each time you create a new application, Kuzzle proposes them off the shelf, allowing you to focus on building **high-level, high-value business functionalities**.

Kuzzle enables you to build modern web applications and complex IoT networks in no time.

* **API First**: use a standardised multi-protocol API.
* **Persisted Data**: store your data and perform advanced searches on it.
* **Realtime Notifications**: use the pub/sub system or subscribe to database notifications.
* **User Management**: login, logout and security rules are no more a burden.
* **Extensible**: develop advanced business feature directly with the integrated framework.
* **Client SDKs**: use our SDKs to accelerate the frontend development.
