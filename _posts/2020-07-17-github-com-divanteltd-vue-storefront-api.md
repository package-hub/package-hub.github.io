### Vue.js storefront for Magento2 (and not only) - data backend


Vue Storefront is a standalone [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (Progressive Web Application ) storefront for your eCommerce, possible to connect with any eCommerce backend (eg. Magento, Prestashop or Shopware) through the API.

Vue Storefront is and always will be in the open source. Anyone can use and support the project, we want it to be a tool for the improvement of the shopping experience. The project is still in the prove of concept phase. We are looking for Contributors and Designer willing to help us the the solution development.

Vue Storefront was build as a all-in-one front-end for eCommerce. For providing the best performance we decided to use Vue.js as a front-end library, Node.js + Express (and maybe GraphQL support) as a server-API, Elastic Search as a database of products and full PWA/off-line support.
Here you can read more about the proof of concept for [Vue Storefront connected with Magento2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magento2-nosql-database-pwa-support-piotr-karwatka).

Besides a big improvement for the shopping experience, we also want to create a great code base for every developer who needs to work on a front-end application for the eCommerce.
